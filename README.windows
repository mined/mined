What is MinEd? (Pronounce "min-ed")

Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive and easy-to-use 
user interface and fast, small-footprint behaviour.

For an overview of major features and highlights, see https://mined.github.io

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows stand-alone version of mined installs itself into a sub-directory 
of the "Program Files" directory (as configured on your system).
It makes registry entries to be available for text files in the 
Windows Explorer context menu, and in the command PATH for invocation 
from a Windows console command line.
You have these options to start mined:
* In Explorer, right-click on a text file and select "MinEd".
* In a command prompt, type
	WINED options files
  to start a mined window with the given files.
* In a command prompt, type
	MINED options files
  to invoke mined in the Windows console window.

Note: In a separate mined window (using the context menu or calling 
WINED), Windows keyboard mapping is enabled by default; i.e. control 
keys are assigned the typical Windows functions, like Control-C, 
Control-X, and Control-V for Copy/Cut/Paste functions.
In a console mode invocation (calling MINED), the mined default 
keyboard mapping is enabled. The mapping can be changed from the 
Options menu.

Info: The Windows version of mined was built with cygwin and uses the 
mintty terminal application as a window container.
