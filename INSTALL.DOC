Guide to compilation and installation of the MinEd editor


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build
	(see below for exotic systems, esp not supporting make)

- Go to the main package directory (the one containing this file),
  then invoke make:
	make
  or call the mined build script:
	./makemined

  This automatically selects a suitable makefile in the 'src' 
  subdirectory for the most common operating environments, based on 
  the output of the 'uname' command.
  It also generates an include file 'm-objdir.inc' to set the binary 
  target directory (used only with 'mkinclud.cc', not 'mkinclud.gcc').

  -------------------------------------------------------

  To override automatic selection of the makefile and use gcc, 
  you may invoke:
	CC=gcc make

  -------------------------------------------------------

  On a 64 bit system, makefile.gcc tries to find out the proper 
  library directories.

  -------------------------------------------------------

  To build a version that does not need the terminfo database 
  (accessing with the termcap API) but works on modern terminals, invoke:
	make mansi

  -------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to check mined with curses, you may invoke:
	make minced

  This uses the ncursesw library which supports UTF-8. Using curses is 
  discouraged, however; see COMPILE.DOC for further comments.

  -------------------------------------------------------

  To build a statically linked version, use the LDFLAGS variable as a 
  makefile parameter to add the respective compiler options:
	make LDFLAGS="-static-libgcc -static"
  or (with older gcc):
	make LDFLAGS=-Bstatic

  This may be useful for running on a similar machine 
  without termcap/ncurses libraries installed.

  -------------------------------------------------------

  If compilation fails, you may try to select a suitable makefile 
  in the subdirectory src:
	cd src; make -f makefile.<system>
  On some systems (e.g. SunOS) that host both Gnu and other development 
  environments, you may have to invoke gmake explicitly:
	cd src; gmake -f makefile.gcc
  (The main directory make script takes care of this automatically.)

  Choose one closest to your operating system. Try makefile.bsd 
  for BSD style Unix, or makefile.sun for System V style Unix.
  Also please consult the file COMPILE.DOC for some hints on how to 
  adapt a makefile for your system. In this case, if you need help, or 
  if you finally succeed, please send a note to mined@towo.net so I 
  can extend the range of automatically supported systems.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build on exotic systems

  Android
	Install the following Apps:
		C4droid (needed as container for gcc)
		GCC for C4droid
		Better Terminal (for shell and terminal)
		UniversalAndroot (needed to access gcc) for Android < 4

	In a terminal (Better Terminal recommended) get root access with
		su
	Then in the src subdirectory, call the script
		sh mkmined

	To install, run
		sh mkmined install

  VMS / OpenVMS
	In the src subdirectory, call the script
		@vms-make
	to build mined in an architecture-specific subdirectory
	([.VAX], [.ALPHA], [.IA64]).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminal control library
  Mined uses the termcap API (unless built as mansi or on VMS, DOS, Android) 
  which it finds in a static or dynamic runtime library, either 
  termcap, tinfo, ncursesw or ncurses (due to a bug in older ncurses 
  libraries ncursesw is preferred) - the makefile will automatically 
  select the best working arrangement.
  (It does not need the ncurses-devel package for compilation.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install options

- For installation into the usual system directories under /usr 
  of your target system, being the super-user (root), invoke:
	make install

  Alternatively, to install into /usr/local, invoke:
	make localinstall

  Alternatively, to install into /opt, invoke:
	make optinstall

  Different assumptions about the subdirectory structure are taken 
  for these 3 install targets (as configured in makefile.*), 
  corresponding to typically different filesystem hierarchies.

  -------------------------------------------------------
  Install targets

  To install mined to a specific location, especially as a non-root 
  user, a number of options are available, for example:

  To install into $HOME/usr/bin and $HOME/usr/share, invoke:
	make install root=$HOME
  or (equivalent):
	make install DESTDIR=$HOME
  or (equivalent):
	make install INSTALLROOT=$HOME

  To install into $HOME/bin and $HOME/share, invoke:
	make install prefix=$HOME

  To install into $HOME/opt/mined, invoke:
	make optinstall root=$HOME

  -------------------------------------------------------
  Install details

  The default install directories and the directory for installation 
  of the Mined runtime support library can be modified by setting 
  the following variables when invoking make; defauls are listed here:
  For all install targets:
	root=/
  For make install:
	prefix = $(root)/usr
	rundir = $(prefix)/share/mined	# on most systems
	rundir = $(prefix)/share/lib/mined	# on SunOS, HPUX, UCB
  For make localinstall:
	lprefix = $(root)/usr/local	# on most systems
	lprefix = $(root)/sw		# on Mac OS X
	lrundir = $(lprefix)/share/mined

  So, to select an individual installation directory, e.g. 
  if you are not the "root" user, or if you are preparing a 
  system-specific package, invoke something like
	make install prefix=/software
  or
	make install root=tmp.mined-package
  or
	make optinstall root=$HOME
  or
	make localinstall lrundir=/opt/mined

  To change a makefile to regularly install to other locations, adapt 
  the first few variables in the makefile you use (src/makefile.*).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation actions

  This installs the binary program, the manual page, the online help 
  file, and the runtime support library, to appropriate locations as 
  used by various systems.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup: Access to Mined runtime support library

  Mined needs access to some files in the Mined runtime support library 
  (online help file mined.hlp, uprint script).
  If it is not installed in one of the usual places, 
  configure the user environments so that MINEDDIR contains the 
  path name of the Mined runtime support library (so that 
  $MINEDDIR/help/mined.hlp and $MINEDDIR/bin/uprint are found).
  The PC binary versions do not need this directory.
