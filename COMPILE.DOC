To build MinEd from this package, first try the makefile according to 
the instructions in INSTALL.DOC - only if that turns out not to work 
on some system, you should proceed with the hints in this file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to compile MinEd


The make script makemined checks a number of systems already and invokes 
an appropriate makefile.
If this fails, go into the 'src' subdirectory.
Select a makefile closest to your operating system.
For your convenience, you may set a link
	ln -s makefile.<selected> makefile
The script 'configure' in the main directory sets this link based 
on assumptions of the 'makemined' script.
It also generates an include file 'm-objdir.inc' to set the binary 
target directory (used only with 'mkinclud.cc', not 'mkinclud.gcc').
The binary target directory will be a subdirectory of 'bin', based 
on 'uname' and 'uname -m', to enable build for different architectures 
from the same directory; to use another target directory, invoke
	make OBJDIR=...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adapting the makefile if needed


Individual makefile

If you don't find a working makefile, try to adapt one, especially 
select a suitable screen handling mode as commented in the makefile.
5 basic modes are available:
* termio (Unix)
* sgtty (Unix, BSD-style)
* curses (Unix and others, but not recommended)
* conio (DOS-based, detected automatically)
* ANSI (selected if none else chosen and conio not detected)
Also consider the other settings, e.g. the sysV variable (see makefile).


Flags

Additional flags for compilation and linking can be supplied with the 
environment variables $WFLAGS and $LDFLAGS respectively.


Screen control / the case against curses

Mined prefers to be compiled without curses for a number of reasons.
Older Unix curses implementions used to behave quite clumsy at output, 
much more than direct terminal control, and they obstructed the use of 
8-bit character sets long in the post-ASCII ages.
(Even in 2004, the curses function 'meta' to enable transparent 
8-bit input fails to work as announced - on Linux ncurses, if the stty 
setting istrip is in effect, additional direct termio manipulation 
is needed to enable 8-bit input; on SunOS curses, there doesn't seem 
to be a way to make this work at all.)
Also even as of 2004, curses does not yet support UTF-8.
There is, however, a build option to use curses; it was originally 
intended for a quick port to VMS (not the current re-port).

The newer ncurses library does not have these problems any more.
With ncursesw 5.4, it works with UTF-8, but is still buggy (opening a 
menu over double-width characters will produce display garbage, 
display of UTF-8 codes with more than 3 bytes crashes ncurses); the 
crash bug seems to have gone with ncursesw 5.7.
And curses still has another major drawback: it is less flexible with 
respect to colour configuration (selecting a foreground colour only, 
with default background, or background colour only, are not 
established with reasonable documentation at the interface; 256 colour 
mode of xterm is not really supported).

There is a make target to compile a curses version while keeping the 
system-specific adaptations of the various makefiles:
	make minced
This make target uses ncursesw in order to support UTF-8. Its development 
package (libncursesw[N]-dev[el]) needs to be installed in this case.
On some systems, ncurses headers are deployed into a subdirectory. It may 
be necessary to add a parameter like
	make ICURSES=-I/usr/include/ncursesw minced


Source file generation

(This step is not needed anymore since mined 2000.15)
On some systems (esp. MSDOS), the build procedure for generated source files 
does not work; you can cross-generate the charmaps and keymaps files 
on a Unix or cygwin system, in the subdirectory src using the commands:
	make pc
	make keymaps.t


Workarounds for compilation problems

On some systems, the compiler may fail to compile the large tables 
for character encoding, keyboard mapping, or Han character descriptions.
On SunOS on Intel, cc did not compile the old format of handescr.t 
(out of memory); on SunOS on Sparc, /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc just hangs on 
compiling it.
With 2011.18, the table storage format of handescr.t has changed so that 
it can be compiled on (most of) these systems.
On Max OS X, cc did not compile keymaps.t (strings too long);
also here the unknown linker option -d y would have to be tweaked. Use 
gcc to avoid the problem (CC=gcc make or CC=gcc gmake) or use the 
makemined script. With 2012.21, the problem may have been resolved.

Use these compilation defines (via the make variable OPT)
to disable certain large tables:

OPT=-DnoCJKcharmaps to disable CJK character encodings
	(affects charcode.c and mousemen.c (charcode.h and charemen.t))
OPT=-DnoCJKkeymaps to disable CJK input methods
	(affects keymaps.c)
OPT=-DnoHANinfo to disable character information from the Unihan database
	(affects handescr.c)
OPT=-DNOCJK to disable all of the above
OPT=-DNOCHARNAMES to disable Unicode character names
	(affects edit.c)
OPT=-DNODECOMPOSE to disable Unicode decompositions
	(affects edit.c)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special interoperability notes


Immediate detection of resized terminal

With 2013.23, an alternative mode for catching Window size changes 
was implemented (as a workaround for cygwin 1.7 which did not interrupt 
select() or read() on WINCH - this was fixed in 1.7.18).
This could be enabled for systems that don't interrupt select() on WINCH 
by #undef selectread in io.c; it works by not using select(), applying 
VTIME timeout and restarting read().


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special notes for specific platforms


SunOS SUNWspro C compiler

Some releases of mined used to be linked statically on SunOS in order 
to make it backwards-portable to a SunOS system without termcap or 
curses libraries installed. However, since recent SunOS versions 
(5.10), static libraries seem to be no longer available by default, so 
dynamic linking is the default again.

To produce a statically linked version with the non-gnu Sun makefile 
(makefile.sun), use the LDFLAGS variable as a makefile parameter 
to add the respective compiler options to trigger static linking:
	make LDFLAGS=-Bstatic
Error messages saying that -ltermcap and -lc are not found indicate 
that static libraries are not installed so static linking is not 
possible. Try another machine or the gnu environment instead.


SunOS ucb C compiler

With this system, the space-optimised version of the keyboard mapping 
tables cannot be compiled.
The ucb makefile provides a workaround to use the plain tables.
This is achieved by two settings in makefile.ucb:
KEYMAPSDEP=keymapsi.h
KEYMAPSFLAGS=-Ikeymaps0 -DNOSTRINGTABLES
With 2012.21, the problem may have been resolved.


AIX

For AIX, the Han character information table would not be compiled and 
is disabled in the source.


Mac OS X

If you do not have a compiler installed yet, you may get yourself an 
Apple ID (free Apple Developer registration), from 
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
download the "Command Line Tools for Xcode" and install the package.

Formerly, neither sed nor gcc seemed to be able to handle the long strings 
occurring in the raw Radical/Stroke input method tables or previous 
mined versions.
(An alternative format was introduced (with 2000.13.2) and a 
pre-transformed table for Radical/Stroke included in the distribution 
as a workaround. This should help on other platforms too which have 
this problem.)
The new tweaked table format should also resolve the issue.


HP-UX

On an older version of HP-UX, the keyboard mapping tables could not 
be compiled because some entries were too long for the preprocessor.
The option -H20000 is passed to cpp (from makefile.hp) to resolve this.
On a newer HP-UX installation, this might compile well without the option
(and maybe on an older one as well with the new tweaked table format).
If you run into this problem, you can also get around it by 
configuring out the Radical/Stroke input method from keymaps.cfg, 
using a "#" character to comment the line out.


Interix

The space-optimised version of the keyboard mapping tables cannot 
be generated in the usual way (due to a memory problem of sed), here 
also caused by the Radical/Stroke input method.
The Interix makefile provides for a workaround.
(The optimised version could however be compiled if taken from a 
different platform; this would save about 400KB in the binary program.)
With 2012.21, the issues should be resolved.


Cygwin

Note: A Windows/cygwin binary version of mined is available from the 
mined web site http://towo.net/mined/.
The cygwin download archive includes the cygwin libraries needed 
by mined, so it can be used without an installed cygwin environment.

The cygwin version compiles seamlessly (using the gnu makefile).
There are also binary and source packages available with the cygwin 
distribution.

Note: The cygwin version of mined runs well in Windows command prompt 
windows, the cygwin console, and cygwin terminals like xterm, mintty, 
urxvt.
It does not run in pure DOS (or DOS emulators like DOSBox).


MSYS (MinGW command environment)

To compile mined for an MSYS/MinGW environment, the MSYS version of the 
compiler is needed, not the MinGW compiler!
(See http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Create_an_MSYS_Build_Environment for 
installation.)

The sources contain a number of __MINGW32__ conditionals from an 
incomplete and unsuccessful porting attempt to MinGW before the distinction 
of the two compilers was unveiled. They are not relevant for the MSYS build.


DOS/all

Including keymaps table files separately would not work due to the long 
file names of some of them (djgpp fails on the make dependencies, 
although not in FreeDOS, Turbo-C cannot include them). Therefore 
the concatenated keymaps file (now keymaps.t) is kept; also it is 
now included in the distribution, so it does not need to be generated.
If you change the configuration of charmaps or keymaps files, however, 
make will want to regenerate them which does not work on DOS;
see "Source file generation" above.


DOS/djgpp

Note: A djgpp-compiled DOS/Windows binary release of mined 
is available from the mined web site http://towo.net/mined/.

To compile mined with djgpp, you will have to go into the 'src' 
sub-directory and address makefile.dj or makefile.dos explicitly, 
or copy it to makefile for convenience:
	cd src
	copy makefile.dos makefile
	make

Compiling large tables may not work, depending on the system.
CJK tables (CJK codepages, CJK input methods, and Han character information) 
are disabled in the sources.
In DOSBox, also disable Unicode character information to compile edit.c:
	make OPT=-DNOCHARNAMES
(works without this limitation on FreeDOS).

In a Windows environment, the djgpp make.exe may crash after every 
single compilation (and would have to be restarted for the next); a 
remedy is to use cygwin make with djgpp gcc for all compile steps, 
then use djgpp make for final linking:
	... # prepare PATH and DJGPP environment for djgpp gcc
	cd src
	cp makefile.dos makefile
	/bin/make
	make

The makefile.dj or makefile.dos produces a stand-alone version, using 
the pmode/dj DPMI module which is available from the djgpp distribution.
(See the makefile for its URL.) This does not work, however, on DOSBox, 
due to the inability of the DOSBox COPY command to concatenate two files.
On DOSBox, a real-mode binary is produced instead.

Note: The djgpp-compiled DOS version is a "dual-mode" executable that 
runs in pure DOS as well as in a Windows command console (supporting 
long file names there in Windows 98, 2000, or later), including the 
cygwin console.
It does NOT run, however, in cygwin terminals like xterm, mintty, rxvt.


DOS/other

Turbo-C (Borland C) (deprecated):
Proper handling of ^C and ^S fails despite all attempts to use DOS/BIOS 
calls to fix it.

EMX (very deprecated):
The promise of the EMX environment to be able to compile 
dual-mode applications does not hold - at least not with curses.
EMX cannot compile the table with CJK character information 
(handescr.h), reporting virtual memory exhausted, so this feature has 
been disabled for EMX.
EMX building was reenabled with 2000.10 but deprecated again with 2000.16 
as there have always been lots of compilation and make problems and 
there is no advantage compared to the cygwin and djgpp versions.


OpenVMS

The VMS build script vms-make.com checks some 'make'-style dependencies 
and uses an object library for the character mapping tables.
It uses the CC/DECC compiler.
For the VAX machine target, some large tables are disabled in the 
sources: Unicode character names and decompositions, 
CJK character encodings and Han character information.
(CJK input methods are not disabled.)
Although there are some conditionals for the VAXC compiler in the sources, 
this is not a complete port as some desired features are just missing.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging features

Mined supports three specific debugging features:
* Using printf (to stdout) and redirecting to a different terminal, 
  as mined reopens /dev/tty for its own display output.
* Putting debug code (printf and other) at the beginning of the line, 
  i.e. not indented.
* Using #ifdef debug_whatever conditional compilation.
The latter two options are detected by the makefile to prevent accidental 
slipping of debug code into the build.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build and source generation

To build mined, several source files, especially tables with a suffix ".t", 
are generated under control of the makefiles (mkinclud.mak, mk* scripts).
As these are included in the source distribution archive, it is supposed 
that this generation only occurs on development systems, thus no legacy 
compatibility is strived for during this process.

Some tools (uniset) and source files (Unicode and other character 
information files) are automatically downloaded.

Build dependencies include some non-standard Unix commands:
iconv, unzip, gzip, groff (for man groff_char, nroff, tbl)
wget
(optional: ctags, zip)
