Mined suppresses backup file names from the command line 
file list if they appear after their base version name 
as generated by command line auto-completion, in order to prevent 
their accidental editing; thus after file name "x" the following 
would be excluded from the file list (where N is a number):
"x~", "x;N", "x.~N~", 
so that, e.g., mined x* edits x and x1 but not x~.

-EX	\fI(character set)\fR
Where X is one of B/G/C/J/S/K/H: Selects one of the 
supported CJK character encodings for text interpretation 
and disables auto-detection of CJK encodings.
For details, see CJK encoding support.
For more details on supported encodings, see the 
Character encoding flags listing 
in the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags section.
.TP
-EX	\fI(character set)\fR
Where X is one of U/L or another 1-letter character 
encoding tag: Selects Unicode/UTF-8, Latin-1, or one 
of the other supported character encodings for 
text interpretation.
For details on supported encodings, see the 
Quick Options (Mode indication) flags listing.
.TP
-E=charmap	\fI(character set)\fR
Where charmap is a character encoding name (as 
reported by the locale charmap command):
Selects the respective character encoding for 
text interpretation.
For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
see Locale configuration.
.TP
-E.suffix	\fI(character set)\fR
Where suffix is a character encoding suffix ("codeset") 
as used in locale names:
Selects the respective character encoding for 
text interpretation.
For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
see Locale configuration.
.TP
-E:flag	\fI(character set)\fR
Where flag is a 2-letter indication used by mined to

Selects the respective character encoding for 
text interpretation.
For details on supported encodings and their flags, 
see the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags listing.
.TP
-Eu	\fI(buffer encoding)\fR
Enables Unicode buffer mode which always maintains the 
Copy/Paste buffer in Unicode, thus facilitating conversion 
between different encodings being edited.
For details, see 
Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion.
.TP
-E?	\fI(character set)\fR
Determine the encoding(s) of the text file(s) given 
as parameters by auto-detection, print out the

.TP
-E \fIor\fR -E-
\(->NEW\(-> 
Disable text encoding auto-detection and derive it

.TP
-KX	\fI(input method handling)\fR
Configure the Space key to perform a certain function 
in keyboard mapping selection menus 
("CJK input method pick lists"), where X is one of:
 'n' to navigate to the next choice (like cursor-right), 
 'r' to navigate to the next row (like cursor-down), 
 's' to select the current choice (like Enter).
.TP
-K=im-im	\fI(input method selection)\fR
Select input method and/or standby input method (for 
quick switching with Alt-k).
The syntax is the same as for the optional environment 
variable MINEDKEYMAP (see below).
.PP
.SS Terminal mode
.TP
-U	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Toggles UTF-8 screen handling assumption, i.e. selects 
UTF-8 screen handling unless UTF-8 keyboard input is 
already selected (by another -U 
option or environment setting).
In the latter case, -U 
deselects UTF-8 terminal operation.
This option should normally not be used as the mode should 
be configured in the environment (see 
Locale configuration).
.TP
+U	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Selects UTF-8 screen handling.
Note that none of the options -U 
or +U needs to be used if 
the environment is correctly configured to indicate 
UTF-8 as it should (see 
Unicode handling / Terminal environment).
.br
Also, mined performs auto-detection of UTF-8 terminal 
encoding and UTF-8 terminal features (different width 
data versions, handling of double-width, combining and 
joining characters), so even if the environment is 
not correctly configured, mined should work without 
this explicit terminal mode parameter.
.TP
+UU	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Selects bidirectional terminal support. 
This mode implies UTF-8 and also assumes that Arabic 
ligature joining (of LAM/ALEF combinations) is 
applied; it will be handled by mined accordingly.
.TP
+UU-U	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Selects bidirectional terminal support 
without Arabic ligature joining (like mintty).
.TP
-cc	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Assumes that the terminal does not support combining characters.
By default - unless otherwise detected - mined assumes 
that combining characters work on UTF-8 terminals and 
do not work in CJK terminals.
.TP
+c	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Assumes that the terminal supports combining characters.
This is enabled by default for UTF-8 terminals, and 
disabled by default for CJK terminals, unless otherwise 
detected.
.TP
+EX	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where X is one of B/G/C/J/X/S/x/K/H: Assumes a CJK encoded 
terminal in one of the supported CJK character encodings.
For details, see CJK encoding support.
.TP
+EX	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where X is one of g/c/j: Assumes a CJK encoded terminal 
in one of the CJK character encodings like G/C/J and 
also assumes that the terminal cannot display GB18030 
4-byte encodings, CNS 4-byte encodings, EUC-JP 3-byte 
encodings, respectively.
.TP
+EX	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where X is one of U/L or another 1-letter character 
encoding tag: Assumes a Unicode/UTF-8 or Latin-1 
encoded terminal, respectively, or an 8-bit terminal 
running one of the other supported character encodings.
For details on supported encodings, see the 
Quick Options (Mode indication) flags listing.
For details on terminal encoding support, see 
Terminal encoding support.
.TP
+E=charmap	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where charmap is a character encoding name (as 
reported by the locale charmap command):
Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
see Locale configuration.
.TP
+E.suffix	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where suffix is a character encoding suffix ("codeset") 
as used in locale names:
Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
see Locale configuration.
.TP
+E:flag	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Where flag is a 2-letter indication used by mined to 
indicate the respective encoding as text encoding in 
the Encoding flag:
Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
For details on supported encodings and their flags, 
see the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags listing.
.TP
+E?	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Determine the terminal encoding and further terminal 
encoding features and properties by auto-detection, 
print out the information and quit.
.TP
-C	\fI(character set and terminal mode)\fR
(Deprecated.)
Turns a subsequent -E option 
(with a single-letter CJK tag) effectively into a 
combined -E and 
+E option.
So mined assumes the given CJK encoding for both 
terminal encoding (unless overridden by UTF-8 terminal 
auto-detection) and text encoding.
Can be used for quick indication of CJK terminals 
(e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm) if locale environment 
is not properly set.
.TP
+C	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Displays unknown characters on CJK terminal:
Assumes a CJK encoded terminal (e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm; 
more specific encoding specification is advisable), and 
characters encoded in a CJK encoding format are 
displayed transparently even if they do not map to a 
valid Unicode character.
.TP
+CC	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Displays invalid characters on CJK terminal:
Implies +C, but even 
character codes that do not match the encoding scheme 
(e.g. wrt. to specified byte ranges) are written 
transparently to the terminal.
.TP
+CCC	\fI(terminal mode)\fR
Displays extended characters on CJK terminal:
Implies +CC and overrides 
auto-detection of the terminal capability to display 
CJK 3-byte / 4-byte codes which would by default 
suppress their display if the terminal does not support them.
.TP
+D	\fI(keyboard assignment)\fR
Setup xterm (by sending dynamic configuration codes) to 
apply two useful keyboard handling modes:
Del key on small keypad sends DEL character rather 
than an escape sequence and can thus be distinguished 
from the Del key on the big (numeric) keypad.
Prepend ESC to character if pressed with the Alt or Meta 
key in order to enable Alt-commands (e.g. Alt-f to 
open the file menu, Alt-Shift-H to enter HTML markers etc).
(Unfortunately this cannot be done by default as it cannot 
be undone because the previous state cannot be detected.)
(This xterm setting should rather be configured permanently 
as suggested in the sample file Xdefaults.mined 
in the Mined runtime support library.)

This assigns the more usual functions "goto line 
beginning", "goto line end" to the Home and End keys

Mined is always in insert mode. Commands are single control

collection of function keys (for various types of keyboards and 
terminals). As a specialty, note the prefixing 'HOP KEY' which 
amplifies or expands the effect of certain commands "just as 
you would expect"; this provides for more command flexibility 
without having to remember too many keys. It is described in a 
separate section below.
.SS Keypad layout
Control key layout for basic movement functions is topographic 
on the left-hand side of the keyboard (an idea originating 
from early editors, when keyboards didn't have cursor keypads).
(Although using a cursor block is more comfortable, a simple 
set of control key assignments is useful as a fallback on 
terminals or remote connections with reduced functionality.)

The right-hand cursor block of typical keyboards is assigned 
the most important movement and paste buffer functions.

HOP cursor-left or HOP cursor-right, respectively.

.SS Menus
Mined provides three kinds of menus, all can be opened with 
either mouse clicks or commands.
The menus offer the most important editing functions (apart 
from simple movement).
Some menus have their items grouped into sections, some of which 
have subtitles.
.br
The HOP flag can be toggled while a menu is open with any 
of the HOP key, ^G, Space, or the middle mouse button.
When a pull-down menu is opened with the middle mouse button, 
the HOP variation is initially triggered, offering the HOP 
variations of the menu items.
.br
The three menu groups are used as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
A \fIpull-down menu\fR is opened by clicking the mouse 
on the menu header (in the left part of the top screen line) 
or scrolling the mouse wheel on this header.
.br
\fIShortcut:\fR Each pull-down menu can also be opened 
with ESC or Alt and the small initial letter of the menu 
header (Alt-f or ESC f for the file menu etc.).
.IP \(bu
A \fIflag menu\fR is opened by clicking the 
right mouse button on a flag indication in the flags area 
(right part of the top screen line) 
or scrolling the mouse wheel on it.
The flag menus have optional markers in front of each item 
showing which items are currently active.
.br
\fIShortcut:\fR The Info menu, Input Method (Keyboard 
Mapping) menu, Smart Quotes menu, Encoding menu can also be 
opened with Alt-F10, Alt-I, Alt-K, Alt-Q, or Alt-E, respectively 
(or use an ESC prefix instead of an Alt- modifier respectively).
.IP \(bu
The \fIpop-up menu\fR is placed above the text area and 
can be opened with a right-click or Alt-Space (ESC Space).
.RE
.PP
.SS 	Menu navigation
When a menu is open, the cursor-left or cursor-right keys 
cycle through the pull-down and flag menus.
Alt-cursor-left and Alt-cursor-right navigate quickly between 
the two sets of menus (pull-down or flag menus).
.br
When a submenu is open, cursor-left goes back to the 
parent menu, cursor-right opens its next menu to the right.
.PP
	There are three methods to navigate within a menu:
.RS
.IP \(bu
With the keyboard: open menu as described above, navigate 
with cursor keys or by typing the first letter of the desired 
menu item (which cycles through all items starting with that 
letter, or containing a word starting with that letter);
activate menu item with Enter key.
.IP \(bu
With mouse clicks: open menu with click (and release) 
mouse button, switch to other menu with another click, click 
on item to activate it. The mouse wheel may be used to navigate 
menu items.
.IP \(bu
With mouse dragging: open menu with mouse button (left or 
right), browse menus and items with button held down, activate 
selected item with releasing mouse button.
.RE
Methods may be mixed, e.g. open a menu with either mouse click 
or keyboard, navigate with mouse wheel, then select with Enter.
.PP
When selecting a menu item, in most cases the associated function 
is carried out and the menu closed afterwards.
In some cases, an option is toggled and the menu stays open 
(esp. in Info menu: Han info pronunciation selection, 
character information "with" attributes selection).
.PP
.PP
.PP
	\fIScrollable menus:\fR In a low-height terminal (e.g. 24 lines), 
longer menus (especially the Encoding menu and the Input Method 
menu) may not fit on the terminal. All menus are scrollable 
with cursor keys, including Page Down/Up, Home, End keys.
.br
When the window size is changed, open menus are closed in 
order to prevent resizing and repositioning problems; this is 
planned to be enhanced in a future version.
.SS 	Hints
.PP
	\fINote:\fR Your mouse driver or Windows system may be 
configured to generate multiple (e.g. 3) mouse wheel events on 
one mouse wheel movement (e.g. with Windows). An option 
-L1 could compensate for that 
scaling (as mined applies a mouse wheel factor by itself which 
is 3 by default).
.PP
	\fILayout configuration:\fR See Menu 
display below for configuration of menu appearance.
.PP
	\fIConfiguration hint:\fR On Unix, in order to make Alt work 
as a modifier, set the xterm resource metaSendsEscape to true 
and the rxvt resource meta8 to false as suggested in the 
example file Xdefaults.mined in the 
Mined runtime support library.
(With older versions of xterm, setting eightBitInput to false 
may be required instead; this xterm option doesn't actually 
disable 8 bit input as its name might suggest.)
With xterm, this setting can also be enforced dynamically with 
the +D option.
.SS Interoperable and multiple paste buffers
.SS 	System paste buffer / Clipboard
\(->NEW\(-> 
In the Windows/cygwin version, Shift-Ins inserts the Windows 
clipboard rather than the mined paste buffer. Copy to paste 
buffer always fills paste buffer and the clipboard, too.
\(->NEW\(-> 
In this case, the lineend type is not copied from the clipboard 
(i.e. typically CRLF) but adapted to the current line.
.SS 	Inter-window paste buffer
Mined can perform copy/paste operations within different 
editing sessions (parallel or subsequent invocations of mined): 
The command HOP Ins (e.g. ^G ^P) will insert the most 
recent paste buffer copied or cut in any of the user's mined 
sessions.
This can also work remotely in a network; to configure this 
features, see 
Common paste buffer configuration.
.SS 	Multiple paste buffers
Mined provides emacs-style multiple paste buffers that 
are organised as a buffer ring. Every buffer cut or copy 
operation (that places the text between the marked and the 
current position to the buffer) creates a new buffer and 
stacks it to the list of buffers.
If the feature "deleted word/line appends to buffer" is enabled 
(+VV) the commands delete-end-of-line 
(^K), delete-word (^T) and delete-end-of-sentence (currently 
emacs mode only) append to the top buffer (disabled with the 
option -VV).
.br
To paste a non-top-most buffer, paste the most recent buffer 
first as usual, then use the buffer-ring command 
(Alt-Ins or Ctrl-F4, or M-y in emacs mode) to 
exchange the pasted text with the previous buffer. This 
can be repeated, going down the stack of buffers, and at 
its bottom, starting over from the top again.

Mined highlights text selection visually, with both 
mouse selection and keyboard selection.

.br
The Delete key is the only function

.SS 
Rectangular copy/paste
Rectangular copy/paste area mode can be toggled on the

.br
\(->NEW\(-> 
Rectangular selection can also be toggled temporarily by using 
Alt with the left mouse button while moving the mouse for

.IP \(bu

TAB, double-width, or isolated combining characters, or even 
incomplete character codes.
.RE
.SS Text position markers
A default marker for quick use and additional 
\(->NEW\(-> 
16 numbered text markers are available. 
.br
Marker 0 has a special function: 1. it is set when opening a 
file at the memorized position, 2. whenever a new current 
marker is set, the previous one is pushed to marker 0.
.br
For keyboard commands to set and move to markers, 
see Text marker navigation
in the Command reference below.
.SS Text position marker stack
In addition to the explicit text markers, 
mined implicitly maintains a marker stack to support navigation 
and orientation when browsing files.
Whenever a command moves the position by a far distance 
(Go to marker, Go to line, Go to file beginning/end, 
Go to next/previous file, Search functions including Search 
identifier definition across files, Replace with confirm), the 
current position is first pushed to this stack.
Later, in order to return to the previous position, use 
the command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) to move along the positions 
in the marker stack.
The command HOP ESC Enter (HOP Alt-Enter) moves again forward 
along the stack.
.SS Paragraph justification / word wrap
Manual paragraph line/word wrap is invoked with the 
justify command (ESC j or ESC J); it justifies the current 
paragraph (wraps its lines/words) according to the effective 
margins and paragraph termination mode.
.br
\fIClever justification:\fR With ESC j, mined automatically 
determines left margins depending on the current paragraph and 
line contents. Heuristic detection of numbered items will trigger 
automatic indentation.
.br
\fINormal justification:\fR With ESC J, mined justifies 
strictly according to the margin values currently configured.
.br
See commands listing below "ESC j" 
for margin setting commands.
.PP
\fIParagraph termination modes:\fR
Two different definitions of paragraph end are available.
.RS
.IP \(bu
The primary mode is to add a space at the end of each line 
when the paragraph continues and to end the line without 
space where the paragraph ends. This seems an intuitive 
way and as a big advantage over other approaches, it is 
transparent with respect to visual formatting, i.e. no 
text property is required that would affect visual layout 
of the text.
.br
\fINote:\fR Additional visual support of paragraph end 
detection is available with the mined option -p that 
distinguishes paragraph/line end display.
.IP \(bu
The other word-wrap mode is to add an empty (blank-only) 
line after each paragraph. Obviously this imposes more 
additional requirements on text formatting discipline and 
reduces freedom of text layout.
.RE
The mode in effect is indicated in the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags display; 
see description of Quick Options (Mode indication) flags.
.SS Auto indentation
By default, mined acts in auto-indent mode: When you enter a 
newline, the following line will be filled with the same 
prefix of space characters (Space or Tab) as the current one.
This option can be toggled from the Options menu.
A new line without auto indentation can be entered 
with the ^O command.
.PP
	Auto indentation is automatically suppressed if text is entered 
very fast (by heuristic detection of input speed) in order to 
allow unmodified copy and paste using terminal mouse functions.
.SS \(->NEW\(-> 
Advanced list support (bullet and numbered lists)
A new paragraph (according to the currently selected 
paragraph end mode, or considering Unicode paragraph separators) 
after a bullet or numbered item will clone the bullet or 
auto-increment the numbering.
The undent function (smart Backspace) considers list bullets 
or numberings, removing the last level.
.br
\fINote:\fR An item paragraph is considered to start at 
a bullet or numbering even if the previous line does not 
terminate a paragraph.
.SS 	Structure input commands
A pair of parentheses with matched indentation can be entered 
by prefixing a parenthesis character with HOP.
For example, HOP "{" would enter a pair of "{" "}", both 
auto-indented on their respective new line. Other pairs are 
"(" ")", "[" "]", "<" ">".
.br
	HOP "/" enters an indented Javadoc comment frame.
.SS 	Back-Tab (Undent function / reverse indent)
\fISmart backspacing:\fR A Backarrow key from a position that is 
only preceded by white space on the line and on the line above 
will revert the input position to the previous matching 
indentation level.
To avoid auto-undentation ("Delete single"), use 
Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow to delete only one character left, 
or toggle auto-indentation off from the Options menu.
.br
\fINote:\fR In xterm, Ctrl-Backarrow only works if configured 
in your X configuration, see the example configuration file 
Xdefaults.mined in the 
Mined runtime support library.
.br
\fINote:\fR\(->NEW\(-> 
Configuration option plain_BS (command line 
option +Bp) switches the Backarrow key 
from smart backspacing to plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent 
and only delete one combining character of a combined character.
Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing then.
.SS 	Tab expansion
With one of the options -+8, 
-+4, -+2, 
a Tab key input will be expanded to an appropriate number of 
Space characters instead of inserting a Tab character. You can 
still insert a literal Tab character with Ctrl-V Tab.
.SS Search and replace multiple lines
Mined has overcome the typical Unix tool limitation of line 
orientation in search operations.
Search and replacement patterns can contain embedded newlines. 
Enter a newline (linefeed character) in the search string with 
^V^J or \\n (or \\r to match CRLF newlines).
(In some cases there are still display problems; then update 
the screen with the ESC "." command.)
.SS Header line underlining
The command HOP "-" (e.g. Ctrl-G -) underlines the 
header line before the cursor position with as many "-" 
characters as needed; it applies to the current line unless 
the cursor is at a line beginning in which case it applies to 
the previous line.
.SS Automatic backspace mode adaptation
There is much confusion about what character codes are delivered 
by the Backarrow and Del keyboard keys in different 
operating environments and configurations.
For proper operation, the "stty erase CHAR" configuration should 
generally be set correctly to reflect the actual code emitted 
by the terminal.
Mined detects this setting and adjusts its handling accordingly, 
so that the "Backarrow" key should normally work as expected 
(delete a character left).

.SH Handling files with mined
.SS Tags file support / Identifier and file lookup
The ESC t command moves to the definition of an identifier 
(on which the cursor should be placed) using the tags file 
(generated by the ctags command). 
HOP ESC t prompts for an identifier. (Also available from 
search or popup menu.)
If a new file is opened for this purpose, the current 
file is saved automatically.
.br
As a special function, if ESC t is typed on an include statement 
(line beginning with "#include" or "include"), 
the included file will be opened.
.br
\fINote:\fR Like with a number of positioning commands, 
ESC t places the current position on the position marker stack 
before going to the location of the identifier definition. The 
command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) moves back to that position, 
also saving the current file if needed first.
.SS \(->NEW\(-> 
Encrypted files
Mined edits encrypted files transparently.
.br
For reading or writing an encrypted file, a respective filter is 
used as configured in the runtime configuration file 
$HOME/.minedrc. See the sample configuration 
file in the Mined runtime support library 
for details. It contains pre-configured entries for using 
GnuPG (for files ending with ".gpg" or 
".pgp") or openssl (for files ending with 
".ssl").
.br
Mined does not currently provide handling for passwords or 
passphrases for file encryption. Therefore, any passwords or 
passphrases needed for encrypted file access will either have to be 
entered on every access, or password or passphrase files may be 
used as offered by the respective decryption and encryption commands 
of GnuPG and openssl. See the sample configuration file for examples.
.br
\fINote:\fR If manual password input is used with openssl, 
be careful to remember the password which is newly assigned every 
time the file is written.
.br
\fINote:\fR When editing an encrypted file, the backup file 
will be encrypted, too. Decrypted content is exchanged with the 
filters using pipes, so no intermediate decrypted version is stored 
on the file system. Copy/paste text blocks are not encrypted, though, 
but they are readable for the current user only anyway (on any 
nontrivial file system). The same applies for a recovery file 
that mined writes in emergency cases to save the edited text.
.SS Data safety and security
Mined has a robust and defensive concept of handling edited 
text and file contents in case of any kind of program or 
system errors.
.SS 	Backup files
With command line option(s) +b, 
mined saves a backup copy of any file being overwritten 
(like saving the file being edited, saving to a different file, 
copying the paste buffer to a file).
It supports three backup file name conventions and a few 
combined modes to select among them:
.TP
+b-
no backup files
.TP
+bs
simple backup files: \fIfilename\fR~
.TP
+be
emacs style numbered backup files: \fIfilename\fR.~N~
where N are increasing version numbers
.TP
+bv
VMS style numbered backup files: \fIfilename\fR;N
(using the original notation of the VMS operating system)
where N are increasing version numbers
.TP
+bn
numbered backup files, either emacs or VMS syntax, 
whichever already exists (with a higher version number)
.TP
+ba
automatic backup files, either numbered if numbered 
backups (either style) already exist, or simple
.PP
\fINote:\fR In order to preserve possibly existing hard links 
to the file being edited, it is actually copied, not just 
renamed for the backup version 
(like with joe, vim, or emacs with option backup-by-copying).
\fINote:\fR In mined 2011.19, 
+ba (automatic simple/numbered backup) is the default, and
+b is a shortcut for +ba.
This is subject to change in a future version, however.
\fINote:\fR To select your preference, use the 
runtime configuration file $HOME/.minedrc, 
or include the respective option in the environment variable 
MINEDOPT, or set the environment variable 
VERSION_CONTROL (compatible with usage 
by emacs and cp), with the following mapping:
.TP
VERSION_CONTROL
$HOME/.minedrc
command line option
.TP
none \fIor\fR off
backup_mode -
+b- - no backups
.TP
numbered \fIor\fR t
backup_mode e
+be - emacs style numbered backups
.TP

backup_mode a
+ba - automatic backup mode
.TP
simple \fIor\fR never
backup_mode s
+bs - simple backups
.TP
backup_mode n
+bn - numbered backups (automatic style)
.TP
backup_mode v
+bv - VMS style numbered backups
.PP
\fINote:\fR To place backup files in a different directory 
than the original file, use the environment variable 
BACKUP_DIRECTORY or BACKUPDIR.
It can be either an absolute pathname (e.g. 
$HOME/.backups) or a relative pathname 
(e.g. .~) in which case backup files 
are stored relative to the respective working directory of 
mined.
\fINote:\fR On VMS, backup options are ignored as VMS handles 
backup files natively.
.SS 	File locking
Mined checks and maintains interoperable lock files, which are 
symbolic links mentioning the user and machine currently 
editing the file (not on MSDOS and VMS).
If the user tries to modify the text of a file locked by somebody 
else, mined informs the user and changes editing mode to view-only.
The lock can be overridden (removed or ignored) from the File menu.
.br
Mined implements workarounds for network file systems that do 
not support handling lock files or symbolic links properly: 
cygwin symbolic links that appear as plain text files on 
Samba/CIFS mounted file shares,
\(->NEW\(-> 
and lock files that could be created but cannot be deleted due 
to weird permission configuration of a network file share.
.SS 	Edited text / Recovery files
Every care has been taken to prevent loss of the edited text 
in case of save errors or accidental quit commands etc; mined 
always prompts before discarding any modified text, even when 
editing without an associated filename (in which case other 
popular editors ignore loss of edited text).
.br
There are three cases, however, in which edited text would be lost:
.RS
.IP \(bu
if the user explicitly discards edited text (e.g. ESQ q and 
not answering the "Save?" question with "y")
.IP \(bu
if mined is sent an external terminating signal
(e.g. on terminal I/O error); two exceptions are the SIGKILL signal 
(which cannot be caught by a program) and SIGTERM (see below)
.IP \(bu
in the rare case that mined should fail with an internal signal
(e.g. if out of memory)
.RE
In these cases, mined can save the edited text in a recovery file 
dir/#name# (when editing file 
dir/name); in the explicit case, this 
is only done if the answer to the "Save?" question is "r" 
(to "recover later").
If the edited file is later opened, and a recovery file still 
exists (which is newer than the file being opened), mined will 
display a notice. In the File menu, there is the option to 
recover the text from the recovery file.
\fINote:\fR The recovery file is interoperable with emacs 
(as are the use cases); however, mined is superior here 
because emacs mangles non-ASCII characters in recovery files.
Mind, though, that interoperability with respect to recognising 
recovery files depends on consistent configuration of their 
location; see the directory configuration option below.
\fINote:\fR If mined is sent an explicit SIGTERM signal 
it tries to terminate normally instead, writing modified text 
to the file being edited, including interactive handling if needed.
\fINote:\fR After catching a signal, mined also tries an 
emergency save of the edited text into a "panic file" 
in one of the directories $TMPDIR, 
$TMP, $TEMP, 
/usr/tmp, or /tmp 
(whichever variable is defined first and directory is writable 
in this order; or similar directories under VMS or MSDOS).
The file contains the edited text, identical to the recovery file.
It is written first, before the recovery file, to provide a quick 
save attempt e.g. if the system is crashing and the file system 
of the edited file is no longer available.
\fINote:\fR If possible, mined also tries to continue 
normally after panic handling (unless multiple external signals 
are nested).
\fINote:\fR To place recovery files in a different directory 
than the original file, use the environment variable 
AUTO_SAVE_DIRECTORY or AUTOSAVEDIR 
or BACKUP_DIRECTORY or BACKUPDIR 
as described for backup files above.
.SS 	Overwriting files and \(->NEW\(-> 
Change monitoring
If any command is issued to write to a file not previously 
read in (after change of file name or working directory, or 
with a Copy to file command), mined prompts for confirmation.
.br
\(->NEW\(-> 
Also, if mined detects that the file being edited has been changed, 
it displays a notice and asks for confirmation before saving.
To this aim, mined checks the modification time, 
\(->NEW\(-> file size, 
device and inode (in case the file got replaced by 
rename/move/mount operations).
This is checked if mined is notified of refocussing the window 
(if supported by the terminal), and after shell commands 
(ESC !, ESC c, ESC z).
.SS 	File access permissions
When creating a new file, its access permissions are set 
according to the default behaviour set in the user 
environment (umask setting in Unix).
However, when cloning a file (with Save As / Set Name / ESC n 
/ ESC d), file access permissions of the originally opened file 
are preserved and cloned.
.br
The +x command line option adds 
executable permission to newly created files
but only to those users that are also given read permission 
by the rules above.
.SS Special file types
.SS 	Character or block device files
\(->NEW\(-> 
Mined rejects reading from or writing to a device file in order 
to prevent being blocked.
Exception: /dev/clipboard on cygwin.
.SS 	FIFO files
Mined can edit a FIFO file (named pipe) like any other file.
Before mined can finish loading from the pipe, another process 
needs to have written to it and then close it.
Before mined can finish saving to the pipe, another process 
needs to have opened it for reading.
.SS 	Pipe input
When invoked within a pipe, redirecting input, mined loads its 
text buffer from standard input.
\(->NEW\(-> 
Mined does not manipulate the screen mode before data is available 
from the pipe, so to some extent it can interwork even with 
screen programs providing its input.
.SS 	Pipe output
In the "Editing for standard output" mode (i.e. when invoked 
within a pipe, redirecting output), only one "file save" 
operation can be performed writing to standard output.
If more than one such operations are issued (e.g. using the 
ESC w / F2 , F3, or suspend command) only the first one 
will write the text buffer to standard output; any subsequent 
one is treated as usual (with empty file name).
\(->NEW\(-> 
If mined exits after writing to a pipe, it does not manipulate 
the screen mode after beginning to write, so to some extent it 
can interwork even with screen programs taking its output.
.SS Line end modes and binary-transparent editing
Mined is binary transparent. It can handle all types of 
line ends (Unix (LF), DOS (CRLF), Mac (CR, with option 
+R), 
\(->NEW\(-> 
ISO 8859/EBCDIC Next Line (NL, not after auto-detection of 
text encoding), and Unicode separators (LS, PS)) 
simultaneously in the same editing session. They are indicated 
by different visible line end indications. Files without 
trailing line end can be edited and created (using the delete 
character right function on the last line end). NUL characters 
are handled as virtual line ends. Lines too long for internal 
handling are split transparently (with a "none" virtual 
line end).
.br
	Character codes that are illegal in the currently selected 
text encoding are maintained transparently and are clearly 
indicated (e.g. illegal UTF-8 sequences in Unicode text).
.br
	Files with mixed encoding (e.g. UTF-8 / 8 bit sections) can 
be edited comfortably.
.br
	\fIInput:\fR To enter a NUL character, use ^V # 0 or 
^V < NUL or Ctrl-Space > (if the keyboard supports Ctrl-Space).
.SS File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters
On every file saving command, mined remembers the last text position, 
paragraph justification margins (only if automatic paragraph 
justification is active), selected Smart Quotes style and 
Input Method (Keyboard Mapping), and TAB display width.
File info memory is relative to the working directory, 
using a hidden file info file (.@mined -
mined also handles its DOS short name @MINED~1 
where it occurs, to provide some interoperability with the DOS 
version of mined); previously used file marker files 
(@mined.mar) will be migrated and 
cleared from duplicate entries.
.PP
	\fINote:\fR File information is stored every time the user 
invokes a command to save the file (even if no write is 
performed because the text has not been edited).
When editing that file again (from the same working 
directory), mined will automatically move to that position 
(and set text marker 0 to it).
.SS 	File info grooming
Mined checks and removes duplicate entries (from previous versions) 
in the file info file.
With option +@, mined also 
checks whether file info entries correspond to actual files 
that exist and are visible to the user; 
it will otherwise remove such entries.
Mined can be called with this option alone and will then exit after 
file info grooming. Mind, however, that files may be invisible 
only temporarily (e.g. due to unmounted file systems, or unplugged 
USB drives), and will get their info entries removed then, too.
.SS 
File chooser
To select a filename for a file operation (e.g. open, save, insert, 
write buffer), mined opens an interactive file chooser that presents 
a listing of files and directories in the current directory 
(for the change directory command, only directories are shown).
The list can be navigated and manipulated in these ways:
.RS
.IP \(bu
cursor keys (including page down/up, end/begin)
.IP \(bu
mouse movement and scroll
.IP \(bu
entering a filename prefix which navigates to the first file 
matching it
.IP \(bu
TAB will usually copy the current filename into the editing 
field (if it was partially matching a file name, it is thus 
completed, similar to file completion on the command line but 
case-insensitively)
.IP \(bu
TAB on a directory will navigate the file chooser into it
.IP \(bu
TAB or HOP while the filename editing field is containing 
wildcards interprets the entered file name as a pattern and 
switches to a filtered file listing (recognising
"*", "?", 
"[abc-x]", "[^abc-x]" 
wildcard expressions, no escapes)
.IP \(bu
Enter on a directory will navigate the file chooser into it 
(unless for the ESC d command in which case it is selected)
.IP \(bu
Enter on a selected (or entered) filename will choose the name
.RE
Also, a filename can be typed in directly (being interpreted as 
a filename prefix interactively). The filename or prefix is 
displayed in the title bar of the popup file chooser menu.
When entering file or directory names, the leading ~ notation 
to refer to one's home directory is accepted.
\fINote:\fR The full path name of the currently displayed 
directory is shown as the first entry in the file chooser menu.
\fINote:\fR A few sorting options are offered in the 
"Options" - "File sort options..." submenu.
They can also be preselected with the command line option 
+zX. See the 
file chooser options for details.
\fINote:\fR In the file chooser, filenames are interpreted 
in Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) while file name parameters given on the 
command line are interpreted in the terminal encoding. This may 
lead to inconsistent handling of non-ASCII filenames. Use the 
ESC ? command to display the file name using native encoding.
\fINote:\fR On some file systems, retrieving directory 
information can be slow.
\(->NEW\(-> Mined handles 
this and provides feedback about delayed operation, retrieves 
directory information lazy by page being displayed, and flushes 
display of the file chooser by line to provide visual feedback 
about the file information being retrieved.
.SS \(->NEW\(-> 
File tabs
Mined provides virtual file tabs above the header line, listing 
file names as opened via command line or file chooser. By clicking 
a file name in the file tabs panel, or hold-and-move the mouse 
over them, you can change the file being edited. If the current 
file has been modified it will be saved first.
.SS 
File switcher
The File switcher presents a list of active files to select from, 
comprising files supplied on the command line, and files 
opened or saved later.
Invoke the File switcher with Alt-# or ESC #, or Alt-F3 or ESC F3, 
or from the File menu. The Close file command (from the File menu) 
closes the current file and removes its name from the list.
The list can be navigated and manipulated in these ways:
.RS
.IP \(bu
cursor keys (including page down/up, end/begin)
.IP \(bu
mouse movement and scroll
.IP \(bu
entering a filename prefix which navigates to the first file 
matching it
.IP \(bu
Enter on a selected (or entered) filename will choose the name
.RE
To reload the current file and stay (approximately) at the 
current position, use ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) after reloading.
.SS Page length
The command ESC P sets the number of lines that mined assumes 
to be on a page. So the status line can contain the page 
number to make finding the current position in a print-out 
easy. Also the Goto Line/% command (^G etc.) accepts a final 
 'p' or 'P' in which cases it positions to the top of the given 
page.
This information will be associated and stored with the file 
name if file position memory is enabled; see 
File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters
above.
.SS Restricted mode (tool mode)
Restricted mode is triggered with
\fC

or (if installed)
\fC
.DS

\fR
In restricted mode, only the file opened when mined was started can 
be edited, no commands changing file name reference, involving other 
files (copy/paste), or escaping to a shell command will be allowed.
.SS Version control integration
From the File menu, checkout and checkin commands are 
available that invoke "co" or "ci" scripts, respectively 
(which must reside in the user's command search path).
This offers a gateway to ClearCase or other version control 
systems; mined applies automatic save or screen update 
as appropriate.
.SS Printing
From the File menu, a print command is available that 
prints the text currently being edited.
If the script uprint is installed and configured 
properly, printing works in any selected character encoding.
See Printing configuration for further 
details.
.PP
In Windows, mined uses notepad /p for printing.
.br
\fINote:\fR The font size interactively configured in 
notepad also affects the print size; with a 
fixed-width font, a font size of not more than 10pt gives you 
at least 80 characters per line; if 72 characters per line are

The command ESC Enter goes backward, HOP ESC Enter forward 
in this "stack", even if this means switching the file 
being edited.
.SS Structured editing support
.SS 	HTML support: syntax highlighting and tag entry/matching
\fIHTML tag entry:\fR With the ESC H commands,
opening and closing HTML tags can be entered or (with HOP) a

\fISyntax highlighting:\fR HTML tags and comments, 
\(->NEW\(-> 
attributes and values can be highlighted, or dimmed to set 
them back from the actual text contents; if mined detects a 
dark terminal background (works with xterm and mintty), it 
adds a highlighting background to improve the contrast.
Other highlighting modes apply to HTML comments and JSP code.
This option is activated if the file name suffix is
one of .html, .htm, .xhtml, .shtml, .mhtml, .sgml, 
\ .xml, .xul, .xsd, .xsl, .xslt, .wsdl, .dtd;
it can be toggled from the Options menu.
Additional highlighting of embedded server-side scripting is 
activated if the file name suffix is one of
\ .jsp, .php, .asp, .aspx.
.br
HTML/XML syntax highlighting can be enabled with option 
+H or using 
Preference configuration per file-type.
.br
\fIHTML tag matching:\fR With the ESC ( or ESC ) command,

corresponding to the current one.
.br
\fINote:\fR While you edit within a line and change its HTML

.br
\fIConfiguration hint:\fR The colour used for displaying HTML 
tags can be configured with the environment variable MINEDHTML 
using an ANSI sequence, e.g. MINEDHTML=34 (the default).
.SS 	Search structure match
With the ESC ( or ESC ) commands, mined searches for a matching 
end of various structures, like opening/closing HTML/XML tags 
(see above), matching parentheses or brackets, matching 
comments (/* */), matching conditional macros (#if...), 
mail messages (in a mailbox file), MIME attachments.
See the ESC ( command in the command 
reference for details.
.SS 	Structure input
A structure template with opening and closing ends can be 
inserted with the structured input feature. HOP followed by 
one of { , ( , [ , < enters a corresponding bracket pair, 
HOP / enters a Javadoc comment frame. HOP - enters an 
underlining line matching the previous line.
.PP
Visual structure input is supported by 
Auto indentation
.SS Password hiding
With the option -P, mined hides 
one word (separated by white space) behind the string 
"assword" in a line (to accommodate for "password" or 
"Password") and displays reverse "*" instead.
Password hiding can be disabled with +P.
.br
By default (without any P option), 
password hiding is activated when editing a file whose 
file name starts with "." (Unix "hidden" file convention).
.SS Virtual bold/underline stropping
With the option +ZZ, mined displays 
all-capital words in bold lower-case and supports their input 
using only a first capital letter, then small letters to input 
a word in all-upper-case.
This is to support editing computer programs in Algol-like 
languages in their typical publication look.
Use +Z_ for underline stropping,
disable with -ZZ. Enabled by default 
if the filename ends with ".a68".
.SS Long line splitting
Mined has an internal line length limit (> ca. 1024 characters).
When opening a file, longer lines are split. This is handled

When saving the file, lines will be joined again.
.SS Visible indication of line contents and display
Various options are available to indicate line control characters 
(Tab and line-feed) as well as shifted line display (of lines 
longer than the screen width). 
(So you can see how many dummy blank spaces there are before the 
line ends or how many superfluous blank spaces precede a Tab 
character.)

\fIConfiguration:\fR Display colour of the indications is 
by default red or a dimmed foreground colour; this can be changed 
with the environment variable MINEDDIM, 
display colour for Unicode line end indications and other 
special (esp. invalid) character indications with <span 
class=env>MINEDSPECIAL. Their values should be the 
numeric part of an ANSI terminal control sequence, e.g. 31 for 
red, "33;44" for yellow text on blue background.
MINEDDIM can also be set to an integer 
percentage value (e.g. MINEDIM="50%") 
to have mined apply dim colour to the indications; the colour 
value is computed from the current foreground and background 
colours (if the terminal supports their detection).
.br
For more details and recommended settings see the example 
script file profile.mined in the 
Mined runtime support library.
Default values are compiled in and can be overridden by setting 
the variables to empty values.

\fINote:\fR With the -F option, 
mined limits usage of special characters for line indication 
and suppresses the interpretation of the MINEDUTF* environment 
variables.
.SS Function key help bars
For quick reference of functions attached to function keys, 
modified function keys, and other modified keys (as used for 
accent prefix functions), a number of help bars can be 
displayed in the bottom line.
.br
F1 followed by another F1, optionally modified by a combination 
of Control/Shift/Alt, displays a help line with function 
attachments to the respectively modified function keys; F1 followed 
by Ctrl-1/Alt-1/Alt-Ctrl-1 or Control with a punctuation key 
(e.g. Ctrl-,) displays a help line for the respective accent 
prefix functions attached.
See the F1 help bars command reference for details.
.SS Menu display
Menu borders are displayed using Unicode Box Drawing characters 
in a UTF-8 terminal, using VT100-mode graphics characters if 
they are detected to be available, or using ASCII graphics otherwise.
.br
\fIConfiguration hint:\fR The menu style option 
-Q is available to configure your 
style preference; see also 
Terminal interworking problems for configuration hints 
to deal terminal-related graphics display trouble.
Alternatively, the option -f reduces 
font assumptions and adjusts usage of special characters accordingly.
.br
In addition to round or rectangular corners, also fancy 
item selection display style can be selected 
(-Q).
.br
With a non-UTF-8 terminal, if your system's 
termcap/terminfo database does not indicate the VT100 graphics 
capability for the terminal you use but you know (or want to 
try if) your terminal has that capability, use of graphical 
borders can be enforced with the -Qv 
command line option.

.SS 	Input method
Mined supports a built-in input method for Greek.
Select it from the Input method menu.
.SS 	Accented character input support
In combination with a Greek input method or keyboard, 
mined provides accent prefix support for both monotonic Greek 
and polytonic Greek.
.br
\fBMonotonic Greek\fR uses only one accent, the tonos which 
looks like acute and can be entered with the F6 or Ctrl-' 
prefix function.
.br
\fBPolytonic Greek\fR uses - among many others - 
the oxia accent which is nowadays considered identical and looks 
like the monotonic tonos. However, for historic reasons, there 
are two sets of Greek accented letters with this accent in 
Unicode, one with tonos and one with oxia. While this may be 
considered a design flaw of Unicode, in fact both kinds of 
characters exist and mined provides support for both accents.
The choice of usage is up to the user.
Note, e.g. that
.TP
F6 < alpha >
enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos
.TP
Ctrl-F6 < alpha >
enters the Greek letter alpha with oxia
.PP
Likewise, with mnemonic input
.TP
^V ' < alpha > \fI(using the apostrophe key)\fR
enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos
.TP
^V ┤ < alpha > \fI(using the acute accent key)\fR
.PP
In these examples, < alpha > indicates the Greek letter 
alpha, which may e.g. be entered by selecting the Greek input 
method and typing the a key.

.SS 	Input method
Mined provides the following built-in input methods for Vietnamese:
VNI and VIQR.
Select the input method of your preference from the Input method menu.
.br
It may be more convenient, however, to use the extensive 
accented character input support provided by mined together with 
a normal Latin-based keyboard (so without a keyboard-mapping input 
method), see Character input support for Vietnamese below.
.SS 	Character input support
Mined provides input support for multiple accented characters 
as used in Vietnamese, as well as convenient accent prefix 
functions for combinations of two Vietnamese accents.
Modified Ctrl-/Alt-/Alt-Ctrl- digit keys are used for 
Vietnamese accent prefix functions.
Alternatively, mnemonic character input can be used.
See Accented and mnemonic input support 
for details, and see below for some introducing comments.
.PP
An accent prefix can either be applied to the plain Latin base 
letter, or to a precomposed Vietnamese letter which already has 
one of the accents.
These are:

.SH Character handling support
This chapter describes mined features for character 
manipulation and display of characters and character 
properties. Unicode and CJK specific features are described 
in the respective chapters.
Character input support is 
described separately in the subsequent chapter.
.SS Script highlighting
It may be desirable to distinguish characters in different 
script by displaying their glyphs in different colours.
(This especially allows to distinguish easier between 
similar glyphs as they occur in Latin/Greek/Cyrillic scripts.)
.br
Script highlighting is currently pre-configured for 
Greek and Cyrillic. It uses the terminal's 256-colour mode 
if available.
.br
The scripts to highlight and the colour values to use 
can be configured at compile-time.
See Mined configuration below.
.SS Combining characters
When editing text in Unicode or any encoding that contains 
combining characters, mined supports display and editing of 
combining and combined characters.
.PP
(\fINote:\fR Terminal support for combining characters is 
auto-detected; additional command line options are available 
in case this fails.)
.br
If mined operates on a terminal that handles combining 
characters, it offers two editing modes: combined or separated.
They can be toggled by clicking the Combining display flag 
in the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags 
area (right part of the top screen line), or by the menu entry 
"Options - Combined display";
separated display mode can also be selected by the command 
line option -c.

.IP \(bu
The cursor can be moved into a combined character with 
Ctrl-cursor-left and Ctrl-cursor-right, 
or ^V cursor-left and ^V cursor-right.
.IP \(bu
You can determine the exact position of the cursor if 
permanent character info is switched on (by HOP ESC u or 
with HOP "Toggle Char info" in the Options menu).
.RE
.IP \(bu
Partially editing combined characters:
.RS
.IP \(bu
If the cursor is on a combined character, delete next character 
(e.g. Del on small keypad) will delete the whole 
combined character, with all combining accents.
.IP \(bu
If the cursor is on a combined character, Ctrl-Del 
will delete only the base character, leaving combining 
accents which may then be combined with the previous 
character.
.IP \(bu
If the cursor is within a combined character, delete next 
character will delete the current combining accent only.
.IP \(bu
\fISmart backspacing:\fR Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow 
("Delete single") behind or within a combined character 
will only delete the rightmost combining accent 
(preceding the cursor position) while Backarrow would 
delete the whole combined character.
.br
\fINote:\fR\(->NEW\(-> 
Configuration option plain_BS 
(command line option +Bp) 
switches the Backarrow key from smart backspacing to 
plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent and only delete 
one combining character of a combined character.
Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing then.
.IP \(bu
You can also position the cursor as described above and use 
copy-and-paste operations.
.RE
\fINote:\fR Ctrl-cursor-left and Ctrl-cursor-right 
only work if these keys are configured to emit 
distinguished escape sequences with Control key held down.
With xterm, this works by default.
With rxvt, use the small keypad cursor keys, or enable Control 
on the right keypad with the sample configuration 
file Xdefaults.mined in the
Mined runtime support library.
With mlterm, enable this with the sample configuration 
file mlterm/key in the
Mined runtime support library.
Ctrl-Backarrow can also be configured to work with xterm 
but doesn't appear to work with rxvt or mlterm, 
use F5 Backarrow instead.

.SS Character information display
The command ESC u displays character encoding information in the 
bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); it displays the 
character code in the selected encoding (UTF-8 byte sequence 
in UTF-8 mode) and the ISO-10646 (Unicode) value of the 
current character, as well as Unicode script range and 
character category, width, and combining information.
The Unicode value is displayed with 4 hexadecimal digits if 
the character is in the Unicode BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane, 
16 bit), with 6 digits if it is a Unicode character outside of 
the BMP, and 8 digits if it is an ISO-10646 character outside 
of the Unicode range.
The information displayed also indicates all kinds of 
encoding irregularities.
.br
For the Unicode data version used for character properties 
see the mined change log.
.PP
Permanent display of character information is toggled 
with HOP ESC u or by selecting "Char info" in the Info menu 
(or with HOP "Toggle Char info" in the Options menu).
.PP
In the Info menu, attributes that are shown with the character 
information can be selected:
Unicode script name, Unicode character name,
\(->NEW\(-> 
Unicode named sequence, 
Unicode character decomposition, list of input mnemonics.
Note that Unicode named sequence information only applies to a 
small number of named sequences, otherwise normal character 
information is shown instead; also, it is only shown in combined 
display mode, so normal information can be quickly toggled by 
switching to separated display mode (middle-click on 
у flag).
.PP
Character information display can be selected with the 
+?c command line parameter (see 
parameter description for further options).
To preselect continuous character information display, append 
+?c to the environment variable MINEDOPT 
or enable option "display_charinfo" in the runtime configuration file 
$HOME/.minedrc.
.SS 	Han character information display
CJK-specific character information (semantic and pronuciation 
hints) is described below in section 
Han character information display.
.SS Character conversion features
.SS 	Case conversion
The case conversion functions (ESC C, HOP ESC C, F11, HOP F11, 
Shift-F3) cover the full Unicode range.
They also handle special cases like Greek final sigma, 
optionally Turkish "i", case mapping to multiple characters, 
and Lithuanian special conditions.
Japanese characters are toggled between Hiragana and Katakana 
by the same functions.
.br
Shift-F3 cycles casing of a word between all small, title case 
(beginning capital), and all capitals. It handles title casing, 
using Unicode title case characters for the first character 
when appropriate.
For Japanese script, it toggles the word between Hiragana and 
Katakana.
.br
The case mapping is based on the most recent Unicode 
version compiled into mined (for the actual version see the 
mined change log and the Options menu About command).
It is applicable in all text encodings.
.SS 	Line end type conversion
In the Options menu, a submenu "Lineend type..." offers functions 
to convert the line end of the current line to LF or CRLF, 
or to convert the line end type of all lines that do not have 
a special line end to LF or CRLF.
.SS 	Numeric conversion
Commands are available to insert characters corresponding to 
a hexadecimal character code or hexadecimal/octal/decimal 
Unicode value contained in the text, to insert a 
respective value corresponding to the current character, or 
to toggle the preceding character and its hexadecimal Unicode value (Alt-x).
For details, see the section 
Code conversion in the Command reference.
.SS 	Numeric entity (HTML/URL) conversion
HTML numeric character entities (e.g. &#x40; or &#64; for @) or 
URL escape notation (e.g. %20 for space, %C3%86 for к) 
can be converted into unescaped characters. Use one of the 
Mnemonic character substitution commands 
(ESC _ or national variants) described below.
.SS 	Mnemonic conversion
A character mnemonic at the cursor position can be replaced with 
its associated character. Use one of the 
Mnemonic character substitution commands 
(ESC _ or national variants) described below.
.SS 	Encoding conversion support
A special feature offers interactive conversion to or from 
Unicode character encoding, see 
Encoding conversion support in 
chapter Unicode support below.
.SS 	Unicode Copy/Paste buffer
The Copy/Paste buffer can be operated in Unicode mode in 
which case it converts between text edited in different 
character encodings.
See Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion 
below.
.SS Smart quotes
In Smart quotes mode, straight (double or single) quote 
characters Ф"╗ or Ф'╗ are automatically substituted with an 
opening or closing typographic quotation mark, depending on 
the text context, or an apostrophe where appropriate.
Also, an acute accent key enters a typographic apostrophe.
\(->NEW\(-> 
Alt-" or Alt-' enter the respective quotation marks of the 
previous or standby style (see below).
.br
Quote marks style selection:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Select the quotation marks style to be applied from the 
Smart Quotes selection menu (open with ESC Q or Alt-Q or 
right-click on the smart quotes indication in the flags area 
in the top screen line).
.IP \(bu
To toggle between the current and the previous smart quotes style, 
middle-click or double-click the smart quotes flag or select 
"standby" from the menu.
.IP \(bu
\(->NEW\(-> 
To select the smart quotes style suitable for the current locale, 
select "by locale" from the menu. This is also achieved with the 
configuration option smart_quotes or 
the command line option -q.
.RE
.br
Quotation marks style can be preselected by either of the 
mechanisms described below.
.PP
The smart quotes left/right selection algorithm considers both 
the text context and the state (whether an open quote was 
inserted before) to automatically support smart quotes also in 
CJK text, and to try to distinguish an apostrophe from a quote mark.
\(->NEW\(-> 
At a line beginning, always a left (opening) quotation mark is 
chosen, supporting the habit in some languages to repeat 
opening quote marks for each new paragraph inside a quotation.
.br
French quotation marks spacing is automatically applied (using 
no-break space U+00A0) if French style has been selected from 
the menu or by locale.
.br
A typographic apostrophe can also be inserted with HOP ' (^G ') 
or with HOP ┤ (acute accent), regardless of smart quotes mode.
In smart quotes mode, a typographic apostrophe is also inserted on 
input of ┤ (acute accent).
.br
Straight quotes or accent marks (" ' ` ┤) can be inserted with 
mnemonic compose pairs (^V ^ " or ^V ^ ' 
or ^V ^ ` or ^V ^ ┤, or ^V"# 
or ^V'# or ^V`# or ^V┤# 
respectively).
.br
Smart quotes are applicable in all text encodings provided 
the desired quote marks are contained in the selected encoding.
.PP
When a file is loaded, mined tries to determine the applicable 
quotation marks style in two ways: With file position memory (see 
File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters
above), mined also remembers the last selected smart quotes 
mode for the file.
If that information is not available, mined auto-detects 
existing quotation marks in the file and adjusts its smart 
quotes mode accordingly. The option -q 
overrides this detection.
.PP
\(->NEW\(-> 
With command-line option -q alone, 
quotation marks style is derived from locale information 
(environment variables 
\(->NEW\(-> LANGUAGE, 
TEXTLANG, LC_ALL, 
LC_CTYPE, LANG), or from a locale 
value given with the option as -q=\fIlocale\fR.
For some languages, two styles are predefined, using the primary 
style as active smart quotes style, and the secondary or alternate 
style as standby style, for quick toggling with a middle mouse click 
on the Quotes flag 
(or using the standby entry from the Quote marks menu).
The active quote marks style can also be derived explicitly 
from the locale with the Quotes menu option "by locale".
.br
Option +q exchanges primary and 
alternate quotation marks style, setting the alternate style active.
.br
Without an option -q, the primary 
locale-derived quote marks style is always set as standby style 
to be quickly available.
.br
\fINote:\fR Language-dependent quotations marks styles 
are determined using the compile-time configuration file 
quotes.cfg.
See Quotation Marks Styles 
on the mined web site for a listing.
.br
\fINote:\fR 
Smart quotes style can also be preselected giving the desired 
quotation marks directly, either as command line option like 
-q="Ф╗" or with the environment 
variable MINEDQUOTES 
(see under Environment configuration hints below);
this overrides both auto-detection and the preference 
saved with the cursor position.
.SS 	Smart text replacements: apostrophe, smart dashes, arrows and glottal stop
If smart quotes are active, some other smart input text 
replacements are applied to respective characters being entered.
(Replacement of subsequent character input sequences is suppressed 
during a repeat command entering multiple characters.)

\fINote:\fR \(->NEW\(-> 
Mined smartly avoids inappropriate placement of smart replacements 
as well as double spaces by redundant combination of smart spaces 
and explicitly entered spaces, so you can seamlessly type either 
"bonjour" or " bonjour " 
to enter Ф\0bonjour\0╗ with French quotes, or 
a -- b to enter an en dash although a space is 
initially inserted after it.
.PP
.PP
.SH Character input support
Some character input support features support international 
scripts (especially with Keyboard Mapping and 
Input Methods), others mainly address composite characters.
For the latter, it is useful to explain a few notions:
.TP
\fICombining character:\fR
A character (usually in Unicode) that is defined to combine 
with the previous character into a combined character, to be 
displayed as a single glyph (visual unit).
.TP
\fICombined character:\fR
The glyph combination of a Unicode character (base character) 
with one or more Unicode combining characters.
.TP
\fIComposed character (or composite character):\fR
A character that has one or more accents composed 
into it, or is otherwise composed of components, like the ae 
ligature, to be displayed as a single glyph. It can be a 
single Unicode character or a Unicode combined character 
consisting of a Unicode base character and one or two Unicode 
combining characters.
.TP
\fIAccented character (or diacritic character):\fR
A special case of a composite character where a letter is 
composed with one or more accents.
.TP
\fICompose key:\fR
A number of system and keyboard vendors have equipped 
their keyboards with a "Compose" or "Combine" key. This key - 
when configured and interpreted properly by the operating 
environment - produces a composed character which is then 
provided as input to the application.
.PP
.SS Accented and mnemonic input support
Function keys or character mnemonics can be used to 
enter accented or other composite characters.
(This is also known as digraph function with some editors.)
.br
These character composition functions also work on the prompt line.
.br
(Any composite character configured on your keyboard can of 
course also be entered directly or using the Compose/Combine 
key of your keyboard.)
.PP
.TP
Note that mnemonic input and accent prefix keys can be 
combined in flexible ways, e.g.
.TP
^V ' Ctrl-F6 e
or
.TP
F6 ^V e ^
which both enter U+1EBF (e with circumflex and acute)
.PP
.PP
.TP
Mnemonic input can be applied recursively to compose a character 
for further composition, e.g.
.TP
^V ' ^V a e
enters U+01FD (Т with acute)
.PP
.PP
.TP
Accent prefix keys can use an already precomposed base 
character for further composition; if this does not match an 
explicitly known mnemonic, the base character is decomposed 
first to find a match, e.g.
.TP
F6 Ч
or
.TP
F5 Щ
which both enter U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)
.PP
.PP
.TP
Up to three accent prefix keys can be combined by entering 
them in sequence in order to compose characters with multiple 
accents, e.g.
.TP
F5 F6 u
enters U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)
.TP
Ctrl-2 Ctrl-7 a
enters U+1EB1 (a with grave and breve)
.TP
Ctrl-- Ctrl-: u
enters U+1E7B (u with macron and diaeresis)
.TP
Ctrl-, Ctrl-( e
enters U+1E1D (e with cedilla and breve)
.TP
Alt-7 Ctrl-, < alpha >
.TP
Alt-F6 Shift-F6 Ctrl-, < alpha >
.TP
Ctrl-< Ctrl-` Ctrl-, < alpha >
all enter U+1F82 (alpha with psili and varia and ypogegrammeni)
where < alpha > indicates the Greek letter 
alpha, which may e.g. be entered by selecting the 
Greek input method and typing the "a" key

.SS Keyboard Mapping and Input Methods
Mined supports optional keyboard mapping which is especially 
useful for Unicode or CJK editing.
When a keyboard mapping is selected, input characters or 
sequences are transformed to other characters or sequences, 
typically of a certain Unicode script range.
.br
Keyboard mappings for Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and 
major CJK input methods are preconfigured (they have been 
ordered in the Input Method menu according to the order of 
their respective basic ranges in the Unicode character set, or 
to the order of the letters of the usual abbreviation CJKV for 
East Asian text processing - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
Vietnamese). The Radical/Stroke input 
method provides additional functionality as a special case.
.br
Mined provides compile-time configuration of additional input 
methods; for this aim, further mappings can be generated using the 
mkkbmap script (from tables 
in various formats as used by other editors or supplied by the 
m17n multilingualization package) and then compiled into mined.
See Mined configuration below for details.
.PP
Keyboard mapping works as follows: You enter a key sequence 
that is mapped to a character sequence in the selected 
keyboard mapping table. The transformed character sequence is 
used as input.
.br
As some typical keyboard mappings contain ambigous key 
sequences where one may be a prefix of another, a short delay 
is applied in these cases to allow recognition of any such 
sequence to be mapped. After a timeout, the shorter sequence 
already matching will be used; the timeout can be cut short by 
typing a Space key, the Space character itself will then be 
discarded. (The timeout value is 900 ms by default and can be 
configured with the environment variable MAPDELAY.)
.SS 	Pick lists
Some keyboard mappings, especially for CJK input methods, 
contain multiple choice mappings. In these cases, a selection 
menu is displayed that offers a "pick list" to select a 
character from. A character can be picked with a mouse click, 
or by navigation to the desired choice with the cursor keys 
(down/up, right/left, page down/up) or the '<'/'>' keys , or 
by just selecting the menu row first (cursor-up/down), then 
typing a digit 1-9 or 0 to select the numbered character.
.br
The Space key can be configured to either navigate to the 
next choice, the next row, or to select the current choice; 
see option -K.
If the pick list is too large to fit on the screen, 
the menu will be scrollable or pageable (using cursor keys).
.PP
While navigating through the pick list, the line and the 
selected item in the line are highlighted accordingly; if 
the current item is a CJK character, also its character 
information (description and optionally pronunciations as 
configured with the Han info option of 
the '?' information flag menu) is displayed on the status 
line. If the item is a word comprising multiple CJK characters, 
the information for only the first of them is shown. The 
available information is derived from the Unihan database.
.PP
Keyboard mapping data are based on Unicode. So in CJK text 
mode, the selection menu (the pick list) may contain symbols 
that are not mapped to the active CJK text encoding. In a 
UTF-8 terminal, these will still be displayed but cannot be 
inserted. In a CJK terminal, some characters may not be 
displayed; an empty entry is shown instead. (In a non-Unicode, 
when editing text in a different encoding, there may even 
be characters that cannot be displayed in the selection menu 
but can be inserted.)
.SS 	Input method selection
An active and a standby input method (keyboard mapping) are 
maintained. They can be toggled quickly for text input, also 
on the prompt line.
.br
The current mapping is indicated as the Input Method flag 
by its two-letter script tag in the flags area, showing
"--" if no mapping is active.
.PP
The active mapping can be selected in the following ways:
.TP
ESC k \fIor\fR Alt-k \fIor\fR Ctrl-Alt-F12 \fIor\fR left click on Input Method flag
toggles between current (active) and previously 
selected (standby) input method (keyboard mapping)
.br
(Alt- toggle functions also work on prompt line)
.TP
HOP ESC k (or HOP Alt-k)
clears input method, i.e. resets keyboard mapping 
to none (unmapped input)
.TP
ESC I \fIor\fR Alt-I \fIor\fR ESC K \fIor\fR Alt-K \fIor\fR Ctrl-F12
opens the Input Method (Keyboard Mapping) selection menu
.br
(Alt-I or Alt-K or Ctrl-F12 also work on prompt line)
.TP
right click on Input Method flag
opens the Input Method selection menu
.TP
HOP ESC K \fIor\fR HOP Alt-K
cycles through available input methods / keyboard mappings
.PP
.PP
	If file position memory is enabled (see 
File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters
above), mined also remembers the last selected input method 
for the file.
.PP

.SS CJK and mapped 8 bit encoding support
Mined supports major CJK encodings as well as mapped 
8 bit encodings ("character sets").
Mined has built-in support for a large number of 8 bit encodings 
which appear to be in use or unique for a region. The Encoding 
menu has been structured with submenus to provide a concise 
menu selection feature.
.SS \(->NEW\(-> 
EBCDIC support
Mined supports EBCDIC encoded files (transparently transforming 
them for internal handling) in the "bracket" codepage CP1047 as 
used by the UNIX System Services (USS) on IBM z/OS.
CP1047 is selected with command line option 
-E=cp1047 or 
-E.EBCDIC or 
-E:47.
The character encoding flag indicates EBCDIC with 
"47".
.br
New files in EBCDIC encoding will by default use Next Line 
as line separators; add option -r 
to prefer LF.
.br
New lines can be added selecting LF or NL lineend type 
explicitly with Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter.
.SS Combining characters
In all character encodings handled by mined that contain 
combining characters, mined handles them and provides partial 
editing and an optional separated display mode as described 
above in section  Combining characters.
(CJK encodings EUC-JIS-2004, Shift_JIS-2004 and GB18030, 
Vietnamese TCVN and Windows Vietnamese (CP1258), Thai TIS-620, 
ISO Arabic, Mac Arabic, DOS Arabic, ISO Hebrew, Windows Hebrew).
Handling of combining text characters is properly coordinated 
with the set of combining characters supported by the terminal.
.PP
For Japanese X 0213 encodings, the character codes that map to 
two Unicode characters are supported.
.SS Character code related commands
The command ESC u displays character encoding information in the 
bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); this includes 
the character code, the mapped Unicode character value, 
and optionally script and character category information, 
character and named sequence name, 
combining and Unicode decomposition information, 
and mined mnemonic input information, as configured in the Info menu.
For CJK characters, also Han pronunciation and description 
information is available.
See Character information display for details.
.br
With HOP ESC u, permanent display is toggled.
.PP
Other commands insert the code of the current character, 
insert a character taking its character code or Unicode value 
from the text, or toggle the preceding character and its 
hexadecimal Unicode value (Alt-x).
For details, see Code conversion in the 
Command reference.
.SS Terminal environment for CJK encoding support
Mined supports handling of CJK text encoding in any terminal 
(see Terminal encoding support below).
However, proper display of a wide range of CJK characters can 
obviously only work in either a Unicode terminal (recommended) 
or in a native CJK terminal that runs the same encoding as the 
selected text encoding.
.PP
CJK terminals:
For terminals that support native CJK encodings 
(e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm), the terminal encoding assumed by 
mined can be specified with a command line option or by proper 
locale indication in one of the environment variables LC_ALL, 
LC_CTYPE or LANG.
For available encodings, see Quick Options (Mode indication) flags.
For usage of the +E options, see the 
description of the Terminal 
encoding options above.
For usage of the locale environment variables, see 
Locale configuration.
.PP
\fINote:\fR In native CJK terminals, it is often troublesome 
to find a working encoding configuration and font setup, and 
the locale environment is not automatically set by the terminals.
A collection of wrapper scripts is available 
(
http://towo.net/mined/terminals.tar.gz) to help with this 
setup problem and demonstrate the invocation of a number of 
different CJK and 8 bit encoded terminal windows, along with 
selection of suitable fonts and proper locale environment 
setting.
.PP
\fINote:\fR Native CJK terminals have a different 
assumption of the range of character codes supported in an 
encoding family, e.g. Big5 / Big5 with HKSCS, GB2312 / GBK / 
GB18030, EUC-KR / UHC, EUC-JP without/with 3 byte codes.
For compact handling, mined always assumes the largest superset 
of these encoding families. It does, however, have some features 
to prevent display garbage in most cases when a terminal supports 
a smaller character set:
By default, mined does not display the following CJK 
character codes in a native CJK terminal, i.e. it displays a 
substitute indication for them
(see CJK character display above):
.RS
.IP \(bu
Unknown characters: CJK characters that have no defined 
mapping to a valid Unicode character.

.IP \(bu
Extended characters: CJK characters encoded with 3 or 
4 bytes.
Use the +CCC option to override this

.RE
.PP
Regardless of all these features and options, it may not 
always be possible to prevent display garbage, especially 
if the font used by the terminal does not cover the needed 
character range.
To avoid these problems in general, it is recommended to use 
a Unicode terminal for editing CJK encoded files.

.SH Unicode support
.SS Introduction: handling Unicode encodings
Mined interprets UTF-8 which is a multi-byte character 
encoding of the ISO-10646 character set, part of which is also 
known as Unicode.
When reading a file, it detects UTF-8 encoding automatically 
(unless overridden by explicitly selecting a text encoding with 
a command line option -u or 
-l or -E...).
It can also edit UTF-16 encoded Unicode files (UTF-16 can 
represent the complete 21 bit Unicode subset of ISO-10646).
UTF-16 big or little endian with or without BOM (byte order 
mark U+FEFF) is auto-detected or can be selected with a 
command-line option (see 
notes under Locale configuration below).
.br
UTF-16 is maintained transparently, i.e. a UTF-16 encoded file 
is written back in UTF-16, and if it was beginning with a BOM 
this is maintained.
No explicit UTF-16 entry exists, however, in the Encoding menu 
since the text is internally handled in UTF-8. However, the 
character encoding flag indicates UTF-16 file encoding with either 
"16" (big endian) or 
"61" (little endian).
.SS UTF-8 internal representation, transparent handling of other text
Mined handles UTF-8 representation internally and also edits 
and keeps illegal UTF-8 sequences. This way, if you 
happen to open a Latin-1 or CJK or any other encoded file 
in UTF-8 mode, or switch encoding while editing, or edit a 
file with mixed encoding, the text contents can still be 
edited and you will not loose any file contents information.
.SS Character encoding indication
The upper-right flags area has a character encoding indication 
which shows "U8" if UTF-8 
text interpretation is selected. For Latin-1 text interpretation 
"L1" is shown, for others see 
Quick Options (Mode indication) flags.
You may click on the indication flag to toggle between the 
current and the previous selected encoding.
.SS Character information display
The Character information display 
command ESC u is described above; character information display 
can also be preselected by environment configuration.
In UTF-8 mode, information shown includes the UTF-8 encoding 
byte sequence.
.SS Character input support
With ^V, mined's special character input support is invoked 
(both while editing text and entering text on the prompt line, 
e.g. as a search expression).
With this feature, (in addition to plain control characters) 
a composite character can be entered by its accent combination 
or other mnemonic character description;
a more-than-two letter character mnemonics would be embedded 
in space characters after the ^V.
In addition, numeric character codes or values can be entered 
with leading ^V#, octal/decimal with ^V##/^V#=, Unicode with 
optional u/U/+.
(For examples, see description of the
^V function below.)
With numeric character input, mined supports \fIsuccessive 
multiple character entry\fR according to ISO 14755; if the 
numeric code is terminated by a Space key, another numeric 
character can be entered subsequently; an Enter key 
terminates numeric character input.
.PP
See also the generic section 
Character input support above 
for input support for accented characters and keyboard mapping.
.SS Encoding conversion support
Two functions support interactive character encoding conversion 
(Latin-1 to UTF-8 or UTF-8 to current encoding) 
to partially fix files with mixed encoding.
In either text encoding mode, the search function looks for 
characters encoded in UTF-8 (when not editing in UTF-8 mode) 
or not (when editing in UTF-8 mode); the command is 
HOP ESC ( or Alt-F11 .
Then, convert the character with ESC _ or its national variant 
(see mnemonic character substitution 
commands in the Command reference).
.br
For repeated interactive conversion, both functions can be 
combined into Alt-Shift-F11 (convert current character, then 
search next).
.SS 	Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion
For the Copy/Paste buffer, Unicode mode can be selected which 
maintains its contents always in Unicode, so that Copy/Paste 
of text works between differently encoded files (or sections 
of a file, if encoding is switched while editing) with automatic 
character code conversion.
This mode is only effective while editing with non-Unicode 
encoded text interpretation.
.br
Select this mode with the command line option 
-Eu or in the Paste buffer menu 
(righ-click on the Buffer mode flag "=" or 
"+") and select "Unicode".
.br
Unicode buffer mode is indicated by cyan background of the 
Paste buffer flag (then "=" or 
"+"), except in Unicode text mode.
.SS Smart quotes and dashes
If smart quotes mode is enabled (see the Quotes style menu under 
the Quotes flag left to the Encoding flag and menu), quote mark 
keys will enter typographic smart quotes instead. Smart dashes 
also apply.
See Smart quotes above for more details.
.SS Bidirectional terminal support
A bidirectional terminal (such as mlterm) will probably 
also apply Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining. Mined auto-detects 
this feature and enables bidi terminal handling automatically.
Otherwise, bidi terminal handling can be configured with the 
option +UU.
.br
In this mode, when displaying a menu, underlying text 
lines that contain right-to-left characters are cleared first 
in order to prevent display confusion between the terminal's 
bidi algorithm and the menu position.
.br
Also, with bidi terminal handling enabled, mined assumes 
that the terminal applies Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining 
and properly accounts for this feature in display position 
handling.
.br
In separated display mode, the joining part of the ligature 
is indicated similar to the handling of combining characters.
.SS Input support for right-to-left scripts ("poor man's bidi" mode)
This support feature for input of right-to-left text pieces 
is enabled by default unless the terminal is detected to be 
in bidi mode itself (e.g. mlterm).
.br
"Poor man's bidi" mode is suitable to insert small pieces of 
right-to-left text (words, phrases) within left-to-right text, 
it stores right-to-left text in visual order (see below) 
and works as follows:
.br
After entering a right-to-left Unicode character, the cursor 
position is moved left of it, so subsequent characters will be 
appended left and the text shifted right. Characters are 
stored in visual order while input support is implicit, based 
on the characters being typed. Entering a left-to-right 
character will automatically skip behind the previously 
entered right-to-left text on the line 
and switch to left-to-right direction; this behaviour 
optimizes inserting small pieces of right-to-left text into 
basically left-to-right text; this priority is justified by 
the assumption that this mode (with visual storing order) is 
only useful for inserting small right-to-left quotations into 
left-to-right text and not for editing right-to-left documents 
(which should be stored in logical order).
.br
Newline, Space, Tab, and combining characters attempt to 
behave well according to what was entered before; however, 
intermediate cursor movement is not considered.
.br
\fINote:\fR For proper support of right-to-left text 
editing stored in logical order, please use mined in a 
right-to-left terminal (mintty, mlterm). Adding a feature for 
advanced bidi support in all terminals is being considered.
.br
\fINote:\fR Poor man's bidi mode also works in non-Unicode text encodings.
.br
\fINote:\fR Poor man's bidi mode is similar to the "revins" 
(reverse insert) option of vim.
.SS Unicode line ends
Mined detects and handles Unicode line separators and 
paragraph separators (unless disabled with 
+u-u).
They are displayed as shown above.
Interpretation of these characters as line ends is disabled if 
a file is explicitly opened in non-Unicode encoding (but not 
if non-Unicode encoding is just auto-detected).
.br
If editing Unicode text, HOP Enter will insert a Unicode 
paragraph separator, Enter in a line that already has a 
Unicode line end will insert a Unicode line separator.
Also, the keys Shift-Enter or Ctrl-Enter insert a paragraph 
separator or line separator respectively.
.br
\fIConfiguration:\fR In order to enable shift and control 
with the Enter keys, xterm or rxvt must be configured as shown 
in the example configuration file Xdefaults.mined 
in the Mined runtime support library.
.SS Unicode display
In UTF-8 terminal mode, mined displays all Unicode characters 
if they are contained in the font used by the terminal.
Fonts usually have a substitute glyph to indicate characters 
not contained in the font.
Wide characters (double-width glyphs) are displayed in a 
double-width character cell of the terminal.
Combining characters are displayed either combined or 
separated (see Combining characters below).
.PP
Illegal UTF-8 sequences are displayed with highlighted 
background, using the following indications.
Furthermore, control characters encoded as a UTF-8 sequence 
and control characters in the "C1" range (values 0x80..0x9F) 
will be displayed similar to normal control characters but 
with coloured highlighting.
.TP
8
for an unexpected UTF-8 continuation byte (range 80-BF)
.TP
4
for a 0xFE (254) byte
.TP

.SS Combining and joining characters
Mined supports handling of combining characters, 
featuring optional separate display and partial editing, 
as described above in section  Combining 
characters.
.SS 	Joining characters
If mined assumes that the terminal applies LAM/ALEF ligature 
joining (either configured with the +UU 
right-to-left display option or auto-detected; correct native 
support is known of mlterm), the joined character width will 
be handled correctly in cooperation with the terminal.
In all other terminals mined will apply LAM/ALEF joining itself.
.br
Mined supports ligature joining in both combining character 
display modes:
.RS
.IP \(bu
In combined display mode, the screen position is accounted 
properly.
Also, when deleting a character, a joined ligature is deleted 
together with the base character, just like combining characters.
.IP \(bu
In separated display mode, the joining part of the ligature 
is indicated using the appropriate isolated form, highlighted with 
Unicode special indication background colour (similar to the 
handling of combining characters).
.RE
.SS Search expression limitations
Unicode search ranges can not be very large as all 
included characters are listed in an internal buffer which is 
limited to ca. 1 KB.
.SS UTF-8 preservation and byte-transparent editing
When splitting lines that are too long for internal handling, 
consistency of UTF-8 sequences is preserved (they are not split); 
combining characters may get split off their base characters, 
however, they will join seemlessly as lines are joined again 
(e.g. when saving the file).
Note that isolated combining characters, e.g. at the beginning of 
a line, are always displayed as if in separated display mode.
.SS Terminal environment
Unicode text can be edited in any terminal encoding (UTF-8, 
8 bit, CJK), however, a UTF-8 terminal is preferable.
UTF-8 terminal operation can be configured in either of these ways:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Auto-detection: If the terminal emits cursor position reports, 
mined can uniquely recognise UTF-8 terminal encoding and further 
UTF-8 features 
(see Terminal encoding support below).
.IP \(bu
Environment: By proper environment variable settings. 
For more details, see Locale configuration.
.br
\fINote:\fR In general, it is advisable to start a 
terminal window using a wrapper script that sets a suitable 
locale environment at the same time, in order to support all 
kinds of applications that are more dependent on proper 
environment setting than mined is.
The mined installation also provides the script 
uterm for this purpose, with its own manual page.
(In case uterm is not installed, it is also 
included in the Mined runtime support library.)

.SH CJK support (Chinese/Japanese/Korean Han character features)
Mined provides CJK support features uniformly in Unicode 
and in major CJK encodings. For information relating to 
CJK character encoding see 
Character encoding support below.
.SS CJK input method support
\fIInput methods\fR for CJK characters are supported with 
the keyboard mapping feature.
A number of popular input methods for CJK text input 
are pre-configured, others can be added at compile-time 
with the mkkbmap script.
.SS 	Radical/Stroke input method
Mined provides a Radical/Stroke input method for CJK 
characters with specific functionality in addition to keyboard 
mapping; it works at two-levels, selecting a radical first, 
then a character from a list sorted by stroke count.
If this input method is active, a selection menu for the 214 
CJK radicals is displayed (without prior keyboard input).
The menu displays all variations of each radical. After 
selecting a radical from this menu, a second-level menu 
is displayed, showing all CJK characters based on the 
selected radical, sorted by the number of strokes.
Many of these menus will not fit on the screen and can be 
scrolled.
Pressing Escape here would return to the radical menu; 
pressing Escape there would disable the input method.
To enter a non-mapped character (e.g. a line end), you 
need to disable Radical/Stroke input method temporarily; 
just toggle it back on with Alt-k (or Esc k) or Ctrl-Alt-F12 and 
the radical menu will be displayed again for continued input.
.br
For the Unicode version used as the character data source, 
see the Options - About information or the mined change log.
.SS CJK character display
Combining characters (in both JIS X 0213 encodings and GB18030) 
are handled and the combined characters are displayed properly 
in either combined or separated display mode in a UTF-8 
terminal (like for UTF-8 encoded text).
The following special CJK character indications apply:
.TP
ц\  \fIor\fR
ц

.PP
.SS Han character information display
When the cursor is on a Han character and either descriptive 
or pronunciation information about this character is available 
in the Unihan database (from unicode.org), mined can 
optionally display this information, with a selection of 
display details which may include semantic information and 
various pronunciations.
.br
To enable Han info, select it in the Info menu.
To open the Info menu, type Alt-F10 or right-click the 
"?" flag.
The information can optionally be shown on the status line 
(where it may be truncated if too long) or in a pop-up menu next 
to the character.
.br
Pronunciation information to be displayed can be selected 
in the Info menu.
While selecting multiple pronunciation options, the menu stays open.
.PP
The same information is always shown while you are browsing 
an input method pick list (then on the status line).
.PP
Han character information display can be selected with the 
+?h command line parameter (or 
+?x for short display on the 
status line).
To preselect continuous Han character information display, 
append this parameter to the environment variable MINEDOPT.
.PP
The information includes the character code (in CJK encoding, 
both CJK code and corresponding Unicode value are shown).
The amount of descriptive information (from the Unihan 
database) to be shown can also be preconfigured with the 
environment variable MINEDHANINFO; 
see Han info configuration below.

.SH Terminal encoding support
Mined supports UTF-8 terminals, CJK terminals, Latin-1 and 
other 8-bit encoded terminals.
.SS Terminal feature detection
Mined performs auto-detection of a number of terminal 
features:
.RS
.IP \(bu
For UTF-8 terminals, mined performs auto-detection of 
terminal features (detection of UTF-8 terminal, different 
width data and combining data versions, handling of 
double-width, combining and joining characters).
.IP \(bu
For CJK terminals, mined performs some auto-detection of 
specific CJK terminal features (handling of non-EUC code 
points, handling of extended code range, GB18030, 3-byte and 
4-byte encodings, detection of kterm JIS encoding, detection 
of rxvt emulating CJK encoded terminal, special CJK width 
properties, and terminal support of combining characters).
.IP \(bu
For mapped 8-bit terminals, mined performs auto-detection 
of terminal support of combining characters.
.IP \(bu
For the Unicode version used for width and combining 
character properties, see the Options - About information or the 
mined change log.
.IP \(bu
CJK terminals cannot always be distinguished from 8-bit 
terminals by auto-detection. Neither can the encoding of either 
CJK or 8-bit terminals be auto-detected.
It is thus advisable to setup proper settings of locale 
environment variables (LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG).
Alternatively, the effective terminal encoding can be indicated 
to mined with a command line option (+EX).

.SH Mined Command reference (command and key function assignments)
\fIGeneral note on using keys with Control, Shift, Alt modifiers:\fR
Mined makes use of many key combinations modified with 
Control, Shift, Alt, or a combination of them, as a resource 
for invoking a larger number of specific functions, providing 
modified functionality as well as accented character input 
support.
Some of these key combinations may be limited by local 
environment, especially the window system, or may need 
extra configuration to be enabled.
.br
Especially modified function keys are often intercepted by 
window systems for special functions.
.br
In general, mined interprets an ESC prefix as an alternative 
for an Alt-key combination. For further advice and window system 
specific hints on further remedies, as well as configuration hints, 
to enable modified key input see the 
hint box under Accent prefix keys above.

Sometimes people expect the "Home" and "End" keys to move the 
cursor to the beginning or end of line, respectively.
In the keyboard usage approach of mined, these functions can 
easily and quite intuitively be invoked with "HOP left" and 
"HOP right", i.e. by pressing the keypad keys "5 4" or "5 6" 
in sequence.
So there is enough room left for mapping the most frequent 
paste-buffer functions to the keypad as described above which 
is considered much more useful.
Use Ctrl-Home and Ctrl-End for the line positioning 
functions, depending on terminal support and configuration; or 
use the -k option if preferred to 
switch keypad key function assignments for the Home and End keys.

to be inserted and the input is keyboard mapped to a 
multi-character sequence, only the first character of the 
sequence is inserted repeatedly.
.TP
ESC < count >
Repeat a command < count > times (prompts for rest of count);
this short form is only accepted, however, if the repeat count 
consists of at least two digits (this is to avoid confusion with 
function key escape sequences of certain terminals).
\fIExample:\fR ESC77. enters a line of 77 dots, 
ESC07x enters "xxxxxxx".

For Windows with a cygwin system 
(http://cygwin.com/), 
mined is available as a cygwin package.
.br
Two other versions are available for DOS/Windows systems:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Stand-alone Windows version, compiled with cygwin. It runs 
in a Windows console, Windows terminal (e.g. mintty), or X terminal.
It is packaged together with mintty.
Its installation registers its invocation (in mintty) from the 
Windows context menu for text files.
.IP \(bu
DOS version, compiled with djgpp. It runs on plain DOS (with 
some special support of FreeDOS codepage configuration) or in a 
Windows console window (DOS command window) but not in a 
typical terminal application like mintty or xterm.
It supports long file names in Windows 98/2000/XP/... (not NT4.0).
.RE
See the mined web site 
http://towo.net/mined/ 
for download.

.PP
.SS VMS version
Mined runs on OpenVMS, with a number of specific adaptations 
especially in file handling.
.RS
.IP \(bu
Options containing capital letters need to be quoted, e.g.
MINED "-Qa" [-]*.com.
Mined options can also be passed in the symbol MINED$OPT.
.IP \(bu
Filename wildcard expansion is applied, accepting both Unix-like 
and VMS-native subdirectory notations.
.IP \(bu
File versions can optionally be specified and are handled 
properly; for example, an explicit version opened for editing 
can be saved and will be the most recent version as expected.
.br
\fINote:\fR To combine wildcards with version specifications, 
use VMS-native pathname notation 
(and do not use a final ";" without version specification), e.g.:
[]x*;*
to edit all versions of all files x*
[.cmd]x*;1
to edit version 1 of all files cmd/x*
.PP
.IP \(bu
The file chooser accepts Unix-like or VMS-style directory 
notations for navigation.
Switching to the current directory (TAB or Enter) which is the 
first entry of the file chooser list, displayed in VMS style, 
turns the file list into VMS-style listing of all file versions.
.br
Logical names can be used for direct navigation if a final 
":" is included (like SYS$LOGIN:).
.IP \(bu
Note that opening the file chooser may be slow on 
large directories.
.IP \(bu
If the terminal window is resized while mined is running, mined 
will notice and adjust after an explicit refresh (ESC .). The 
system, however, is not notified of the changed window size in 
this case. Please resize (again) when back on the command line.
.IP \(bu
The capability to accept terminal copy-paste is limited by the 
VMS 80 character input buffer (not limited on emulated VMS, e.g. 
on "Personal Alpha"). For some remote terminals (mintty, rxvt), 
full Unicode data version detection is disabled to reduce 
start-up delay.
.IP \(bu
The file info memory files are called .$mined instead of .@mined,
recovery files are called $name$ instead of #name#.
.IP \(bu
In the VAX version, CJK character encodings, Han character 
information, and Unicode character information tables are not 
included by default. Alpha and IA64 versions include all 
Unicode and character encoding features.

.SS Terminal environment
\fIFor terminal-specific hints, see 
Terminal interworking problems below\fR
.PP
On Unix, the terminal type is determined from the environment 
variable TERM. The termcap/terminfo mechanism 
is used to derive the actual properties of the terminal; for 
some terminals (cygwin, xterm, rxvt, vt*), this information is 
also built-in as a fallback in case terminal information is 
not available on a system (this is especially useful for the 
cygwin stand-alone version).
.PP
Recognition of some special terminal features or restrictions 
is associated with the setting of TERM 
(xterm, linux, vt100, sun*, cygwin, rxvt, *ansi*, 9780*, hp*, 
xterm-hp, superbee*, sb*, microb*, scoansi*, xterm-sco, cons*, 
att605-pc, ti_ansi, mgterm).
Non-trivial screen features (like scroll reverse, add/delete line, 
erase multiple characters) are used if their support is indicated 
in the termcap/terminfo description of the terminal unless other 
information is available (e.g. after terminal version detection, 
an older xterm is supposed not to support erase characters).
Since colour support is often not configured within terminfo but 
modern terminals do support it, mined always tries to apply 
colour attributes (if the terminal at least supports ANSI 
control sequences). A number of other "best practice" approaches 
are taken to optimize the usage of terminal capabilities, esp. 
covering different methods of graphics display support (for 
menu borders).
.PP
For detection of function keys and cursor keys, 
the escape sequences being used by terminals are often 
not known to an operating system environment because they 
are poorly and incompletely configured. Because this does 
usually not work as expected (see this
bug report just for an example), mined does not rely on 
the termcap/terminfo configuration of function key codes alone 
(which it considers however since mined 2000.14); 
rather it always accepts a wide variety of typical codes.
A few ambiguous codes are resolved according to the 
TERM variable.
.PP
In an xterm, window headline and icon text are set to the 
current filename and "(*)" is added if the text has been 
modified.
.SS 	Locale configuration
The locale mechanism as implemented on modern systems has a 
number of design problems, one being that there is 
no explicit distinction between text encoding and terminal 
encoding although this is obviously a very different thing and 
mixed combinations of both may occur and are actually supported 
by mined.
.br
For this reason, mined extends the locale environment variable 
mechanism with the variable TEXTLANG which is 
only considered for assumed text encoding (with precedence 
over the standard locale variables), 
\(->NEW\(-> and also considers 
LANGUAGE with precedence.
.br
\(->NEW\(-> 
If one of these additional locale variables 
(LANGUAGE or TEXTLANG) is used, 
mined also implicitly enables smart quotes.
.br
Also mined provides command line parameters to explicit override 
either text or terminal encoding (UTF-8 terminal encoding, however, 
is always auto-detected if the terminal provides the information).

.RE
.PP
For encoding recognition from locale environment variables, 
mined recognises locale specifications typically found in 
system installations, including those which do not include an 
explicit encoding suffix. Known character encoding suffixes 
("codeset" component of locale name, starting with ".") are 
recognised regardless of whether the given locale is installed 
or not. Other encodings are recognised by region suffix 
(starting with "_") or full locale name or alias.
.br
In addition to hard-coded locale recognition (especially for CJK), 
locale values and associated encodings are configured in the 
compile-time configuration file locales.cfg 
which especially lists locale names that do not have an 
explicit encoding suffix.
You can use these settings (known locale name or generic 
locale name suffix) even on legacy systems without locale 
support to indicate the terminal environment properly to mined.
For encoding recognition from command-line parameters, 
mined provides the following options:
.RS
.IP \(bu
-EX \fIor\fR +EX
with a single-letter encoding tag as listed with the description 
of the 
-E options;
further encoding tags are configured in the compile-time 
configuration file charmaps.cfg.
.IP \(bu
-E=charmap \fIor\fR +E=charmap
with a character encoding name (as reported by the 
locale charmap command).
.IP \(bu
-E.suffix \fIor\fR +E.suffix
with a character encoding suffix ("codeset" of locale name).
.IP \(bu
-E:flag \fIor\fR +E:flag
with a 2-letter indication used by mined to indicate the 
respective text encoding in the Encoding flag.
.IP \(bu
\(->NEW\(-> 
-E- or -E
disables text encoding auto-detection which is then 
derived from the locale environment.

In these options, -E specifies 
text encoding while +E would specify 
terminal encoding to be assumed.

The following table lists encodings and major codepages 
that are recognised by a generic locale suffix or country code;
in addition (as mentioned above), a large number of locale names

assumptions about terminal encoding, supporting both local 
invocation as well as remote login from a PC (e.g. to a Unix

\fINote:\fR
It is not unlikely that the assumption about the terminal 
encoding taken by mined does not match the actual terminal 
encoding (e.g. mined cannot determine the encoding based on 
the ambiguous setting TERM=ansi). Environment variables that 
indicate the character encoding are unfortunately not maintained 
through telnet or remote login.
.br
Explicitly setting TERM to a suitable value after remote login 
may help but may not always work (e.g. pcansi is not a 
known terminal on SunOS).
Explicitly setting locale variables, e.g. LC_CTYPE, 
may indicate the encoding to mined but may cause trouble otherwise; 
some systems like SunOS are dogmatic about interpreting locale 
variables and strictly ask corresponding locale data to be installed 
or they will flood you with bogus error messages.
Also not all encodings, esp. PC "codepages", are known as a 
"locale charmap" on other systems.
.br
In these cases, you can use the explicit +E 
option to force mined to assume a specific terminal encoding; 
see the option values listed above for the main DOS encodings.
.PP
\fINote:\fR
The encoding emulated by cygwin (as configured, or by default 
typically CP1252 for cygwin 1.5, UTF-8 for cygwin 1.7) is not the 
encoding natively applied by the Windows console window (by 
default typically the DOS codepage CP850).
This means that the effective encoding may be different if you 
invoke the cygwin-compiled mined version and the 
djgpp-compiled mined version alternatingly; you may notice this 
by a different range of characters that can be displayed when 
opening the same file with the two mined versions.
.br
Some Windows Latin characters are poorly displayed by the 
Windows console in default configuration; cygwin 1.7 can 
display all characters properly if the Windows console font is 
configured to "Lucida Console" rather than "Raster Fonts".
.br
In a cygwin console on a non-cygwin system (after remote login), 
mined assumes ASCII as the terminal encoding by default unless 
properly indicated by environment variables.
.PP
\fINote:\fR
The following DOS codepages are supported; they are mainly provided

even text encoding (e.g. -E=CP1250 or -E:WE) using the names 
or shortcuts from the list:

For the djgpp version of mined, even the font chosen for the 
Windows console window may affect the effective display encoding.
Configure "Raster Fonts" (except of size "10 x 20"!), not 
"Lucida Console" in order to make sure the effective visual 
codepage is the same as the one selected with the respective 
DOS tools (e.g. chcp) and assumed by mined.
.PP
\fINote:\fR
Mined (djgpp) tries to determine the DOS/Windows codepage 
using the DOS API; this can only work if the codepage was 
properly configured with DOS means (e.g. with CP858 using 
CHCP 858 or MODE CON CP SELECT=858, 
maybe enabled by DEVICE=...\\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,858) 
on old DOS, or MODE CON CP PREP=((codepage list) ...\\ega.cpi)); 
if only the font is switched to a differently encoded one, 
there is no way to detect this - in this case you can still 
use environment setting or the +E 
option as described above to indicate the terminal encoding.

Running mined (djgpp) in a dosemu session (DOS emulator on Linux)

perfectly in that case: ^S and ^Q are interpreted for flow

and the mined option -Qa should be 
used to tune menu borders right.
.SS 	Terminal setup and configuration

includes a number of configuration files providing settings that 
should be applied to various terminals for proper operation of 
several features as described throughout this manual:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Xdefaults.mined for major X Windows terminals: 
xterm, rxvt, some CJK xterm derivates (cxterm, kterm). The script
xinitrc.mined (and optionally kp5) 
can be used to establish the suggested settings.

KDE konsole keyboard definitions
.IP \(bu

.RE
.PP
In some terminals, the cursor may not be well visible or not 
visible at all if the cursor is on a character 
with reverse background (control character, occurs e.g. in xterm) 
or highlighted background (invalid character code, occurs e.g. 
in xterm and rxvt).
See the X resource parameters for "cursorColor" in the example 
configuration file Xdefaults.mined for remedy.
.PP
If mouse wheel movement moves more than expected, especially 
if it cannot move by single items in a menu, this is probably 
a configuration issue with your mouse driver.
You are probably running a Windows-based X server which is 
(often by default) configured to generate multiple mouse 
wheel events on each actual mouse wheel movement.
Often not even in the Control Panel mouse section, but only 
in a configuration menu of mouse-specific setup software 
(e.g. "Browser Mouse Settings"), configure the scroll unit to 1.
.SS 	Terminal interworking problems
With some terminals, problems are known due to missing terminal 
features or terminal bugs:
.PP
\fBany terminal: menu border display\fR
.IP \(bu
If the borders of mined menus appear as letters rather 
than graphic borders, the terminal can unexpectedly not handle 
VT100 graphics.
Use the option -Qa to switch to ASCII 
borders, or -fff to limit font assumptions.
.br
In a UTF-8 terminal, mined uses Unicode Box Drawing 
characters by default.
If they don't display they are missing in the font used by the 
terminal.
Use the option -Qv to switch to 
VT100 graphics or -Qa to switch to 
ASCII graphics. If borders are visible but without corners, use 
-Qs to switch to simple rectangular borders.
.PP
\fBany terminal: slow terminal feature auto-detection\fR
.IP \(bu
On a slow remote terminal connection, escape sequences from the 
terminal (sent for function keys or requested terminal responses) 
may get delayed and split up.
Mined tries to handle delayed parts of escape sequences 
graciously (\(->NEW\(->  improved again); 
however, this is limited as the explicit ESC key shall also be 
recognised.
.br
If messages like "Late screen mode response - ..." 
(after startup), "...awaiting slow terminal response" (esp. 
after startup), "...awaiting slow key code sequence" or 
"...absorbing delayed terminal..." occur, escape sequence detection 
may be adjusted by setting the environment variable
ESCDELAY to a value of 2000 or 3000.
(Delay during startup may apparently also be caused by 
on-demand font loading of rxvt or mlterm, however, mined applies 
special handling for this case.)
.IP \(bu
If proper terminal detection fails for delay reasons, mined 
may especially not be aware of the terminal encoding (and 
display line markers as blocks). In this case, 
exiting and restarting mined should resolve the issue.
.PP
\fBxterm\fR
.IP \(bu
To enable proper Alt-letter command input (for opening and 
navigating menus), set the xterm resource metaSendsEscape to true 
(or with older versions of xterm, set eightBitInput to false) 
in your X configuration (usually $HOME/.Xdefaults 
or $HOME/.Xresources) as suggested in 
the example file Xdefaults.mined in 
the Mined runtime support library.
.IP \(bu
Although it is a waste of keyboard resources to have two 
indistinguishable sets of keypad keys, most terminals provide 
no means of distinguish them towards the applications, at least 
not by default. Especially for a text editor, it is highly 
desirable to distinguish them in order to have a rich intuitive 
function key mapping at disposition which mined tries to achieve.
.br
One approach to improve mapping of useful key functions 
would be actual keyboard remapping (applicable on some terminals); 
this is a delicate approach, though, because it may create 
incompatibilities with other programs that rely strictly on 
installed terminfo information. Mined provides remapping 
recommendations for shifted keypad keys (with Shift, Control, 
Alt and combinations of them) in the configuration sample files 
Xdefaults.mined (for xterm), 
konsole/xterm-modified.keytab (for KDE konsole), 
mlterm/key (for mlterm), 
in the Mined runtime support library.
.br
Due to the compatibility limitations mentioned above, however, 
the two Ins keys remain indistinguishable, and the two Del keys 
are only distinguishable if the xterm configuration resource 
*VT100*deleteIsDEL is set. Also, keypad and function key 
modification with the Alt is ensured with the xterm resource 
*VT100*metaSendsEscape. Both resources are set to true in the 
configuration sample file just mentioned.
.br
These two resources can also be set dynamically with xterm. 
Mined can be told to do so with the command line option 
+D.
(Unfortunately this handling cannot be enabled by default as 
it cannot be undone because the previous state cannot be 
detected.)
.IP \(bu
Mined determines the xterm version in order to apply 
certain workarounds conditionally.
.IP \(bu
If you run xterm in VT220 keyboard mode (using xterm option 
-kt vt220 or setting the configuration resource *keyboardType: 
vt220) you should make sure to also set the environment 
variable TERM=vt220 (e.g. using the xterm option -tn vt220 or 
setting the configuration resource *termName: vt220) so mined 
can properly set up the keypad functions.
.IP \(bu
If you run xterm with the resource modifyCursorKeys or 
modifyFunctionKeys set to value 1, mined will recognise the 
according keyboard sequences with the environment variable 
setting TERM=xterm-sco.
.PP
\fBxterm on cygwin\fR
.IP \(bu
On cygwin, as on other systems, the script uterm 
is recommended to invoke an xterm that is properly configured 
to run UTF-8, and also to use a best choice of fonts for optimal 
Unicode coverage. See README.cygwin for more detailed advice.
.PP
\fBxterm legacy CJK width mode\fR
.IP \(bu
Mined auto-detects and supports xterm legacy CJK width 
compatibility mode (xterm -cjk_width); character 
width and menu border layout are properly adjusted, stylish 
menu borders (-QQ) and fine-grained 
scroll bar display are disabled by default.
(Note: In this mode, combining characters could unexpectedly 
change the width of a character by being substituted with its 
wide precomposed form (e.g. 'a' combined with U+0300) - 
which an application can hardly handle; this bug was fixed in 
xterm 224 with a patch contributed by the mined author.)
.PP
\fBrxvt\fR
.IP \(bu
When starting mined in a fresh rxvt terminal, and maybe 
even after starting your X server, some display (font?)

Rxvt does not distinguish between Shift-F1 and F11 / 
Shift-F2 and F12 / Ctrl-Shift-F1 and Ctrl-F11 / Ctrl-Shift-F2

In rxvt, the two keypad Del keys (small keypad, numeric 
keypad) are automatically distinguished from each other and 
invoke the Delete character (small keypad) and Cut (numeric 
keypad) functions, respectively (Ctrl-/Shift-/Alt- 
alternatives are supported as described in this manual).
This works, however, only if mined can recognise rxvt; it is 
generally a bad idea to set TERM=xterm in rxvt, see also 
hint below.
.IP \(bu
Also in rxvt, the two keypad Ins keys (small keypad left, 
numeric keypad right) are distinguished. The left Ins key 
positions the cursor left of the pasted region, the right Ins 
key positions it right.
.IP \(bu
By setting rxvt in the mode that enables distinction between 
the two keypads, it can unfortunately not distinguish the 
right keypad modified with Ctrl- anymore, so Ctrl-Home/End/Del 
cannot work as desired.
.IP \(bu
Ctrl-modified punctuation keys can be enabled by 
following the configuration samples of the file 
Xdefaults.mined in the Mined 
runtime support library.
.br
Note: Ctrl-modified and shifted punctuation keys 
interfere with ISO 14755 input mode of rxvt; if the following 
key is entered twice, that mode is aborted and the modified 
punctuation key becomes effective as an accent prefix in mined.
.IP \(bu
To enable proper Alt-letter command input (for opening and 
navigating menus), set the rxvt resource meta8 to false in your 
X configuration (usually $HOME/.Xdefaults 
or $HOME/.Xresources) as suggested in 
the example file Xdefaults.mined in 
the Mined runtime support library.
.IP \(bu
Later rxvt-unicode provides a CJK terminal emulation.
CJK display is buggy for characters that rxvt thinks cannot be 
displayed, especially for GB18030 
(LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.gb18030 rxvt) but also 
e.g. for EUC-JP (LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.eucjp rxvt);
single bytes are then interpreted instead which amounts to an 
unpredictable screen width and cannot be correctly handled.
(This applies mainly to character codes that are not mapped to 
Unicode but also to many that are mapped.)
.br
Moreover, CJK width handling is inconsistent for many 
characters in rxvt CJK mode (rxvt claims to adhere to the 
locale mechanism in this respect but that's not the case here - 
character widths are inconsistent with the locale, too).
.br
\fIRemedy:\fR Don't use rxvt in CJK-encoded mode; mined 
CJK terminal support is tailored to native CJK terminals (such 
as cxterm, kterm, hanterm) where it works fine - if you use a 
UTF-8-capable terminal, use it in UTF-8 mode! Mined can edit 
CJK-encoded files well in a UTF-8-encoded terminal.
.IP \(bu
In rxvt, Unicode characters that are Not Assigned are 
always displayed as a single-width replacement character. This 
is not consistent with xterm behaviour which would display 
them as a double-width replacement if they are located within 
a double-width Unicode range (which sounds reasonable). This 
would cause display positioning inconsistencies. Mined has a 
workaround for some of these cases (assuming that rxvt runs 
the most recent Unicode width data version available; or 
actually the same as mined assumes - handling of multiple 
auto-detected terminal Unicode versions does not cover this 
special case).
.IP \(bu
If the X windows servers has duplicate fonts installed under 
a common name (e.g. if it comes with a 10x20 non-Unicode font and 
you install a 10x20 Unicode font in addition), rxvt seems to use 
the wrong (i.e., non-Unicode) version of the font and does not 
find special characters like the default marker used in the flags 
menus (this was observed since rxvt 7.5, rxvt 5.8 was finding the 
proper font). Use the mined option -F to 
adapt mined to limited font usage, or fix the X server installation.
Or use the script uterm to start rxvt-unicode. To 
start rxvt-unicode from an xterm, use uterm -rx.
.IP \(bu
Due to the scrollbar display workaround for hanterm (see 
above), the scrollbar position may be shown as blank space 
instead of coloured (only in rxvt CJK mode with Korean encoding 
and if you explicitly set TERM=xterm which you shouldn't 
anyway in rxvt).
In this case, coloured scrollbar foreground can be enabled 
with the environment variable MINEDSCROLLFG="44;36" or 
MINEDSCROLLFG="38;5;45".
.IP \(bu
As a workaround for an xterm bug on cygwin, mined applies 
terminal size re-adjustment. This may confuse rxvt (being 
resized to an unexpectedly large window) if it pretends to be xterm.
.br
\fIRemedy:\fR in rxvt, make sure that the environment 
variable TERM=rxvt (or rxvt-unicode); the according X resource 
(Rxvt.termName: rxvt) is also listed in the file 
Xdefaults.mined in the
Mined runtime support library.
.IP \(bu
Mined determines the rxvt version in order to use certain

CJK-mode rxvt: rxvt has some character width bugs when running 
in CJK encoding; e.g. when running rxvt in Big5 terminal encoding 
(locale zh_TW), U+FA18 is displayed with wrong screen width 
while in older version U+FFED was display with wrong screen width;
when running rxvt in Shift_JIS terminal encoding, a number of 
character width bugs occur. Mined does not implement workarounds 
for those; in general UTF-8 terminal encoding is advisable to be 
on the safe side.

\fBmlterm\fR

Bidirectional display handling of mlterm is based on the

It is essential to use this configuration especially for the 
HOP key (keypad "5") which is oppressed by mlterm by default,

Character attributes in hanterm used to be all mapped to reverse,

\fBKDE konsole\fR
.IP \(bu
Due to the lack of decent Unicode font support in the default 
configuration of the KDE konsole terminal, menu appearance 
options -QQ and

.IP \(bu
The Mined runtime support library 
includes a configuration file konsole/xterm-modified.keytab 
which defines enhanced escape sequences for function keys and 
other modified keys in order to enable the functionality 
described in this manual. Unfortunately, the qt framework 
used by konsole inhibits the use of some keys and many key 
combinations.
.IP \(bu
It is especially irritating that konsole disregards 
the middle keypad key ("5" in application mode) completely; 
so the mined HOP function has to be invoked by alternative means.
.br
As a remedy, the HOP function is also assigned to the 
"Menu" key (next to the "Windows" key on PC keyboards) by the 
configuration sample file konsole/xterm-modified.keytab;
follow the installation instruction in that file and select the 
keyboard type it defines ("xterm with key modifiers") in konsole, 
"Settings" - "Keyboard" menu.

Another remedy is to reassign the middle keypad key to the 
X key symbol Menu (using xmodmap);
the script kp5 in the

.PP
\fBscreen\fR
.TP
Screen, like luit (see below), is a middle layer between the 
actual terminal and the user terminal environment.
.br
Running screen in a cygwin console produces initial garbage 
input in mined.
.br
[Applies to older screen before version 4: Unfortunately, 
screen does not pass character width handling of its host 
terminal transparently to the application but apparently it 
maintains cursor position information with reference to the 
system-installed locale data. Which, however, does not always 
reflect the terminal properties!
Yet mined detects the proper width properties of the host terminal 
(by using pass-through escape sequences of "screen") but 
only if the environment variable is set to "screen" (the default 
of "screen").]
.br
Worse, however, screen apparently transforms cursor positioning 
commands from the application into relative cursor positioning 
towards the host terminal, which results in grossly incorrect 
display positionining if e.g. screen runs in a UTF-8 terminal but 
assumes an 8 bit terminal. Also, it interprets certain UTF-8 
continuation bytes as control characters, so even using a workaround 
it is not possible to fix display for all cases.
Mined applies a workaround to fix text positioning and menu display 
problems with screen.
Another workaround fixes many cases of UTF-8 character display but 
cannot fix all (since screen captures the output of the 0x9C byte).
It is recommended to invoke screen only with properly configured 
locale environment variables to match the actual terminal encoding.

.SS 	Work-around support to enable 8-bit character set on weird terminals
There exist some exceptionally weird 7 bit terminals that 
have an alternative character set containing composed characters 
which can be displayed simultaneously with the default character 
set. For those there is optional output translation which 
embeds non-ASCII characters into the respective code switching 
sequences. To enable output character transformation, set the 
environment variable MINEDOUT to contain the upper half (with 
respect to an 8 bit character set) of the translation table 
into the terminal's alternate character set.
(Character set switching will be done as specified in the 
termcap (as/ae) or terminfo (smacs/rmacs) entry.)
An example setting of MINEDOUT is included in the environment 
sample file profile.mined in the 
Mined runtime support library 
for Siemens 9780x terminals.
.SS 	Concerning some especially stupid terminal drivers
There used to be terminal drivers which make use of the 
soft handshake mechanism by exchange of ^S and ^Q characters but 
yet pass them through to application programs which is quite stupid.
If it is necessary to ignore such hazardous ^S and ^Q keys, 
the environment variable NoCtrlSQ or NoControlSQ must be set. 
Mined will then not disable the tty channel soft handshake 
setting either.
.SS Keyboard mapping / Input method preselection
With the environment variable MINEDKEYMAP the active or 
standby mapping or both can be preselected. The value is a 
two-letter script tag to set the active mapping, or it is 
prepended with "-" to set the standby mapping, or a combination.
.br
\fIExample:\fR
export MINEDKEYMAP=-gr
will set Greek keyboard mapping standby.
export MINEDKEYMAP=py-rs
will set Pinyin input method active and Radical/Stroke 
input method standby.
.br
The respective tags attached to the keyboard mappings can be 
looked up in the Input Method flag menu; the HOP function 
toggles between display of the full input method name and its tag.
.SS Smart Quotes style configuration
Smart quotes style can also be preselected with the environment 
variable MINEDQUOTES 
(in addition to command line option -q=..., 
standard locale environment variables, or additional locale 
environment variables LANGUAGE or 
TEXTLANG which also implicitly set smart quotes mode).
.br
The value of MINEDQUOTES should contain 
the opening/closing quote pair (or just the opening quote 
mark, double or single quotes) and must be UTF-8 encoded. It 
can optionally append a space and an inner quotation mark (as 
used for nested quotations) for more specific selection. It 
can also indicate French spacing as shown in the example.

See the example file Xdefaults.mined in the 
Mined runtime support library for suggestions.
.SS Printing configuration
Mined uses the script uprint from the 
Mined runtime support library 
to print the current contents of the text being edited 
in any selected encoding (unless the environment variable 
MINEDPRINT is set to direct mined to use a different print command).
.br
If the support library is not installed in one of its 
standard locations (system-dependent), it should be made 
available in the usual command search path.
.br
The script offers a choice of configured printers to select 
one (using either Windows registry 
or \(->NEW\(-> CUPS lpstat).
.br
The script uses either paps or 
uniprint for actual formatting (print preprocessing).
Under Windows (cygwin/stand-alone/djgpp versions), 
mined also considers printing with notepad /p.
.br
paps is available at 
http://paps.sourceforge.net/ and uses the Pango layout 
engine for formatting.
uniprint is part of the yudit distribution; if 
you don't have it installed on your system, there is another 
script makeprint in the support library which can be 
used to download and build the needed uniprint program.
The mined print script (uprint) prefers 
paps if it is available as it has more capabilities 
for printing a wide range of Unicode characters, and it does 
right-to-left formatting.
.br
The font to be used with uprint can be configured with 
the environment variables FONT, FONTPATH, FONTSIZE.
It is recommended to put a sufficient font in the directories of 
$FONTPATH, e.g. DroidSansMono, 
LucidaTypewriterRegular, Bitstream Cyberbit.
.br
The preferred printer can be configured as usual with 
the environment variable PRINTER.
In addition, uprint checks an environment 
variable LPR for an alternative for the 
system printing command (lpr/lp) if that is needed.
.br
\fINote:\fR If printing with uprint fails for 
some reason, mined tries to print with either the print 
command configured in the environment variable 
LPR as a fallback, or with lp/lpr as a last 
resort. Working character encoding support cannot be expected 
in this case, however.
.br
See Environment variables to configure Printing 
for further details.
.SS Display layout
Some of the special indication characters (that substitute 
non-displayable contents) and some of the colours used by mined 
for special indications and interactive elements may be 
configured to the user's preference.
.br
\fINote:\fR For the configurable character indications, two 
environment variables exist each, to configure an 8 bit value 
(Latin-1 encoded) and to configure a Unicode value (UTF-8 encoded).
The UTF-8 encoded values (e.g. MINEDUTFRET) take precedence 
in a UTF-8 terminal. In an 8 bit terminal, or if the respective 
UTF-8 variable is not configured, the Latin-1 encoded value applies.
See the example script profile.mined 
in the Mined runtime support library for 
more details and for a number of suggestions of suitable values.
Mined does not apply any default non-Latin-1 indications in order 
to avoid display problems with fonts that do not support them.
Depending on your visual preference, there are a number of suitable 
Unicode characters for use as indications especially in the Unicode 
ranges of Arrows, Geometric Shapes and Symbols (U+2190-U+2BFF).
.br
\fINote:\fR For the Latin-1 encoded configured indication 
markers (variables MINEDRET etc, not MINEDUTFRET etc), if the 
configured character is in the small letters range (actually 
 '`'...DEL) the alternate character set is used for display. 
This works also in a UTF-8 terminal, provided that the 
corresponding UTF-8-encoded indication configuration variable 
is not set, e.g. MINEDRET=j MINEDUTFRET= (or not defined) 
would indicate line-ends by displaying a graphic lower right 
corner, MINEDTAB='`' MINEDUTFTAB= (or not defined) would indicate 
Tab characters with VT100 graphics lozenge rhombs.
.br
\fINote:\fR For the UTF-8-encoded configured indication 
markers (variables MINEDUTFRET etc), if the marker is a 
double-width character, a replacement will be displayed instead.
.br
\fINote:\fR Mined reduces its assumptions about available 
graphic and special characters for display purposes with the 
options -f or -F.
The -F option also suppresses the 
interpretation of the MINEDUTF* environment variables.
.SS 	Line ends
Line ends are usually marked by a "Ф" double left angle character.
This visual indication can be changed with the environment variable 
MINEDRET (8 bit terminals) or MINEDUTFRET (UTF-8 terminals).
The default or configured marker is used as an indicator at 
the end of every text line on screen (so you can see how many 
blank spaces there are).
.br
Multi-character markers: If a second character is configured, 
it is used to fill the rest of the screen line, a third 
configured character would terminate the indication at the end 
of the screen line. ("ииФ" is a nice setting for people who 
used to work at Siemens terminals.)
Pattern:
\fC
.DS
.br
		<span>MINEDRET=123	# line end displays as 122222223
.br
.DE
\fR
Suggestion for a nice line end on UTF-8 mode terminals 
(check if character is included in your font, however!):
\fC
.DS
.br
		<span>MINEDUTFRET=\*(15	# U+23CE
.br
.DE
\fR
.PP
The indication of DOS line ends (CRLF) and Mac line ends (CR) 
may be configured with the variables MINEDDOSRET or MINEDUTFDOSRET, 
and MINEDMACRET or MINEDUTFMACRET, respectively.
They are also distinguished by different colours.
.SS 	Paragraph ends
With the option -p, mined displays 
distinct indicators for line ends and paragraph ends.
A paragraph is defined to continue while lines end with white 
space (space or Tab character).
The default paragraph marker is "Х" and is also used to indicate 
a line ending with a Unicode Paragraph Separator. It can be 
changed with the environment variable MINEDPARA or MINEDUTFPARA.
.SS 	Tab characters
Tab characters are usually indicated by a sequence of 'и' 
(middle dot) characters.
This can be changed with the environment variable MINEDTAB 
(8 bit terminal) or MINEDUTFTAB (UTF-8 terminals).
.br
Multi-character markers: If two characters are configured, 
the second is used to mark the middle of the Tab span. If three 
characters are configured, the first and last are used to mark 
the beginning and end of the Tab span.
Pattern:
\fC
.DS
.br
		<span>MINEDTAB=123	# Tab displays as 12222223
.br
		<span>MINEDTAB=12	# Tab displays as 11112111
.br
.DE
\fR
.SS 	Long lines
Lines which are too long for the screen are usually indicated 
by a '╗' double right angle (guillemot) character. If the current 
position is behind the screen margin, the line is shifted out left 
which is indicated by a 'Ф' double left angle.
These markers can be changed with the environment variable 
MINEDSHIFT or MINEDUTFSHIFT. The first character is used to 
indicate a line continued to the left of the screen, the second 
character is used to indicate a line continued to the right of 
the screen.
.SS 	Unicode characters
For a description of special display indications in UTF-8 text 
editing mode see "Unicode display" above.
The indication and highlighting mode of a non-displayable Unicode 
character (typically a UTF-8 character in a Latin-1 terminal), 
as well as the highlighting mode (colour) of the indication of 
illegal UTF-8 sequences, can be configured with the variable 
MINEDUNI.
.SS 	Display mode of indicators
It is recommended to display these indicator characters in a dim 
display mode to prevent distraction from the text contents. The 
default is a red colour which is a moderate dark red in xterm.
The display mode can be used by placing the code part of an ANSI 
display control sequence in the environment variable MINEDDIM.
E.g., MINEDDIM=31 would select the default mode, red foreground;
in xterm only, MINEDDIM="38;5;83;38;5;245" gives a moderate gray 
in either 88 or 256 color mode;
in rxvt only, MINEDDIM="38;5;83" gives a moderate gray.
.br
MINEDDIM can also be set to an 
integer percentage value (e.g. MINEDIM="50%") 
to have mined apply dim colour to the indications; the colour 
value is computed from the current foreground and background 
colours (works in xterm, or mintty from version 404). The ANSI 
colour 7 (white) is temporarily redefined for this purpose and 
restored when mined exits.
.SS 	Display mode of menu borders
The display colour of menu borders and menu headers can be 
configured with the environment variable MINEDBORDER.
Suitable values are "35" (magenta), "34" (blue) and "31" (default).
.SS 	Status line highlighting
Highlighted parts of status line messages (e.g. initial letters 
for help selection after F1) can be configured with the 
environment variable MINEDEMPH, using foreground ANSI modes.
The default is "31" (effectively red background).
.SS 	Scrollbar colour
The foreground and background colours of the scrollbar can 
be configured with MINEDSCROLLFG and MINEDSCROLLBG, respectively, 
using ANSI modes; if only the background is configured, 
the foreground is the reverse of it. In general, to support 
fine-grained scrollbar display in UTF-8 terminals, the 
foreground and background colour settings should be the 
reverse of each other.
The default for the background is "46;34;48;5;45" if 
use of 256 colour mode is enabled, or "46;34" if it is disabled.
The default for the foreground is "", meaning that the reverse 
background is used, with a workaround for hanterm (see above).
.SS 	Menu colour and border style
The highlighting background colour of the selected menu item 
can be configured with MINEDSEL, using reverse ANSI modes (i.e. 
using foreground parameters for the background) and MINEDSELFG 
for the foreground, using reverse ANSI modes. The default values 
are MINEDSELFG="43" and MINEDSEL="34", giving yellow on blue.
If selected menu items appear too dark (which mined tries to 
avoid, depending on the terminal), try one of the workarounds 
MINEDSEL="34;1" or MINEDSELFG="43;1".
.br
Menu border styles can be selected with the option 
-Q.
For a nice selection bar that extends from left to right menu 
border, the setting -QQ is 
recommended (this is the default unless the terminal is 
assumed not to provide sufficient font configuration for this 
option; it depends on certain graphic Unicode characters being 
included in the terminal font and can be disabled with 
-Qq).
.SS 	Combining character display
The highlighting background colour of combining characters 
displayed in separated mode can be configured with 
MINEDCOMBINING, using ANSI background modes.
The default value is MINEDCOMBINING=46, to change colour e.g. 
to yellow background, use MINEDCOMBINING=43.
.SS Interactive Help access
Mined looks for its help file in a number of typical directories 
for installation of the Mined runtime support library.
If it is placed in a non-standard location, the environment 
variable MINEDDIR should point to the directory.
(Mined also tries to find the help file in the directory 
where it was started from; this is especially useful for the 
DOS/Windows version.)
.PP
.SS Mined compile-time configuration
.SS 	Script highlighting
The the mined distribution contains a file 
src/colours.cfg; it contains entries with the 
script name (as listed in the Unicode data file 
Scripts.txt), blank space, and a colour index 
into the xterm 256-colour mode. (To make good use of 256 
colour mode, the terminal program should be compiled with 256 
colour support enabled. Configure xterm with 
configure --enable-256-color .)
.br
Edit colours.cfg before building mined to 
adapt coloured script display to your preferences.
.SS 	Encodings and Encoding menu
The mined distribution contains a file src/charmaps.cfg 
which defines the character encodings that mined knows and how 
they are presented in the Encoding menu, together with flags for 
indication in the Encoding flag and tags for use with the 
-E and +E 
options (and the MINEDDETECT environment variable).
.br
The configuration file allows the definition of submenus in the 
Encoding menu.
.br
Each character encoding entry charmap-name must 
correspond to an existing character mapping file 
charmaps/charmap-name.map.
Additional character mappings can be generated with the script 
mkchrmap.
.SS 	Encodings recognised by locale names
The mined distribution contains a file src/locales.cfg 
which maps locale names to associated character encodings.
While this list contains mainly locale names without explicit 
encoding suffix, mined also checks generic locale name suffix 
values and assumes the corresponding terminal encoding.
Thus the given names or suffixes can be used even on legacy 
systems without locale support to indicate the terminal 
environment and preferred text encoding properly to mined.
.SS 	Keyboard mapping (Input method)
The mined distribution contains a file src/keymaps.cfg 
and a script mkkbmap; go into the 
src directory and use the script to generate 
additional keyboard mappings:
The parameter to the mkkbmap script can be one of
.RS

for many scripts listed in the UnicodeData.txt database, 
character names listed there can build a useful 
keyboard mapping; 
mkkbmap will then generate an according 
keyboard mapping file, e.g. for Bopomofo
.RE
Each successful generation of a mapping table adds an entry 
to the configuration file keymaps.cfg; the 
entry is however initially disabled as it usually needs manual 
adjustment: edit the configuration file; enable the new 
entry by removing the leading '#' character, check the first 
element which will be the name of the mapping to appear in the 
Input Method menu, check the last element of the entry 
which is a two-letter shortcut and must be unique for all 
mappings, then move the entry to the position where you want 
it to appear in the menu. You can also group mappings by 
adding "-" lines in this configuration file.
.br
For the Unicode data version used for included keyboard mappings, 
see the mined change log.
.br
For the keyboard mappings generated from Unihan data, 
characters are sorted according to the priorities of their 
Unicode ranges (assigning lower priority to "Supplement" and 
"Extension" and "Compatibility" ranges).
So for some input mnemos, the "pick list" for the Cangjie 
input method is displayed more in order of relevance.
.br
For keyboard mappings for CJK encodings, mkkbmap will add 
appropriate punctuation mapping entries for Chinese, Japanese, 
Korean, respectively, in addition to the entries derived from 
the respective data source.
