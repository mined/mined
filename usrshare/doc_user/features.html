<a name=unicode>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Unicode support and features</h4>
<li> Works with UTF-8 text mode terminals or windows like xterm.
     <br><i>See also the <a href=unicode.html>Unicode howto</a> with 
     information on how to set up a UTF-8 terminal.</i>
<li> Supports independent <i>mix of text encoding and terminal encoding</i>; 
     can edit text in any supported encoding in any terminal encoding.
<li> <i>File encoding auto-detection</i> (Latin-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, East Asian encodings).
     UTF-16 encoded files with BOM or without BOM will be handled 
     transparently and written back in UTF-16.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Editing of <i>mixed encoding files</i> (like e.g. mailbox files); 
     interactive switching of character encoding interpretation.
<p>
<li> Handles single-width and <i>double-width characters</i> 
	(works with dual-width Han fonts; xterm 145 or newer recommended).
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Complete handling of <i>combining characters</i> (display, 
     edit, search, input support, ...).
     <br>Partial editing and <i>optional separated display mode</i>.
     <br>Taking care of <i>isolated combining characters</i> 
     (after line beginning or TAB character) and new Unicode combining 
     characters (which the terminal does not handle yet).
<li> Transparent handling of illegal UTF-8 sequences, with visible indications.
<li> Optional handling of <i>Unicode line ends</i> (line and paragraph separator).
<li> Display support in non-Unicode terminals:
     Characters that cannot be displayed are substituted by a 
     <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif> representation using their 
     base character according to Unicode decomposition.
<p>
<li> <i>Mnemonic input support</i> 
     (RFC1345 with completions to cover Unicode with generic accent 
     mnemonic patterns, HTML, TeX and other mnemos supported).
<li> Extensive accented character input support, including 
     multiple accent prefix keys, covering frequent accents of all 
     Latin-based languages (macron, breve, dot above, ogonek, caron, stroke), and 
     Control-punctuation keys as accent prefix, e.g. Control-comma (with xterm and mintty).
<li> Support for Greek (monotonic and polytonic).
<li> Support for Cyrillic accented characters.
<li> Special input support supplements for Vietnamese multiple accented 
     characters, including composing precomposed characters (e.g. with 
     one accent) with further accents, working in all text encodings.
<li> Numeric input support, conforming to ISO 14755.
<li> Interactive conversion support to or from Unicode.
<li> Enhanced character information display, including character code, 
     Unicode value and a configurable selection of Unicode script, 
     Unicode character name, <img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2015.25>
     Unicode named sequence, Unicode decomposition, character input mnemonics.
     Available in all text encodings.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Configurable <i>smart quotes</i> (automatic replacement of 
     entered keyboard quotes into suitable typographic quotation marks), 
     applicable in all text encodings.
     Automatic quotation marks style detection on file loading.
<li> Smart dashes and smart arrows for various styles.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Bidirectional terminal support (for handling 
     <i>right-to-left scripts</i>), including 
     support for Arabic ligature joining (LAM/ALEF).
<li> Support for Arabic ligature joining on all terminals.
<li> Optional “poor man's bidi” mode (basic input support for 
     <i>right-to-left scripts</i> on non-bidi terminals).
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     <i>Input methods:</i> Keyboard mapping for input support of 
     non-Latin scripts on Latin keyboards (popular CJK input methods, 
     and mappings for Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Vietnamese and 
     Thai input methods are pre-configured, others can be added).
     <br>
     Keyboard mapping supports multiple choice mappings by offering 
     a “pick list” (selection menu) 
     with configurable function of the space key;
     characters in the pick list being sorted by relevance of Unicode ranges.
     <br>
     <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Radical/stroke lookup input method for Han characters supports 
     especially occasional Han character input for not CJK speaking users.
<li> Highlighting (colouring) of certain Unicode Script ranges 
     (compile-time configurable, Greek and Cyrillic preconfigured).
<p>
<li> Supplemental scripts <a href=uterm.html><code>uterm</code></a> 
     and <code>umined</code> to invoke a best-choice configured Unicode 
     terminal window, optionally with mined running in it.
</ul>

<a name=cjk>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>CJK support</h4>
<li> CJK input methods are supported using the generic keyboard mapping 
     mechanism including selection menus for multiple choice mappings.
     Further keyboard mappings or CJK input methods can be added by 
     compile-time configuration.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Han character information with description and pronunciations 
     of CJK characters as listed in the Unihan database can optionally 
     be displayed while browsing text or input method pick lists.
<li> Major CJK encodings (mainly double-byte encodings for 
     Chinese/Japanese/Korean character sets) are supported 
     (handled in any terminal encoding).
     For Big5 and JIS encodings, character codes that map to two Unicode 
     characters are supported.
<li> CJK encodings are auto-detected.
     The encodings to be auto-detected are configurable.
<li> Combining characters are supported for GB18030 and Japanese, 
     including partial editing and optional separated display mode.
</ul>

<a name=mapped>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>8 bit encoding support</h4>
<li> Large number of 8 bit encodings supported that appear to be in 
     use or unique for a region.
<li> Encoding menu is structured with sub-menus to provide a 
     concise menu selection feature.
<li> Combining characters are supported (Vietnamese TCVN, Thai, 
     ISO Arabic, Mac Arabic, ISO Hebrew, Windows Hebrew), 
     including partial editing and optional separated display mode.
<li> Handling of combining text characters is properly coordinated 
     with the set of combining characters supported by the terminal.
</ul>

<a name=terminal>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Versatile terminal feature support</h4>
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Auto-detection of UTF-8 terminal encoding and UTF-8 terminal features 
     (different width data versions, handling of double-width, 
     combining and joining characters).
<li> Auto-detection of CJK terminal properties (handling of non-EUC 
     code points, GB18030, 3-byte and 4-byte encodings).
     Auto-detection of kterm encoding.
<li> Auto-detection of 8 bit terminal support for combining characters.
<li> Standard-comformant but yet flexible locale configuration for both 
     text and terminal encoding.
<li> Interoperable with a large number of popular and legacy terminals 
     with respect to display features and function key detection, 
     including detection of shifted function keys (Shift, Control, Alt), 
     <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     distinction between (often redundant) small and large keypads where possible.
     <br>
     Application of specific workarounds and conditional usage of features 
     (even version specific).
<li> Supporting extended mouse-coordinates mode (xterm 262 and 268, 
     mintty 0.9), for up to 2015 lines/columns screen width.
<li> Applying computed dim screen attribute for line indications (in xterm).
<li> Automatically adjusting HTML highlighting colour to dark background.
<li> Optional 8 bit character input and output support for 
     antique character set switching 7-bit terminals.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Works (in typical terminals) even if “terminfo” database is not installed.
</ul>

<a name=userinterface>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>User interface</h4>
<li> Intuitive and <i>easy operation</i>. No modes.
     Intuitive cursor position handling, no weird limitations 
     (e.g. at line-end) or insert/append confusion.
<li> “Geometric” control-key layout for basic cursor movements (classic 
     “WordStar”-like navigation). (Of course you can also use cursor keys.)
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Use of a “HOP” key which amplifies or expands any subsequent 
     movement command (and some other commands) in an intuitive sense. 
     This way, a lot of functions can be achieved quickly without 
     remembering as many control or function keys.
     HOP and function key assignment to numeric keypad such that 
     most frequently used functions are easily available.
<p>
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     <a href=keyboard.html#keypad><i>Keypad assignment</i></a> 
     optimized for most important navigation and paste buffer functions.
<li> Two-key commands (starting with escape key) for less frequent functions.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Text position stack to go backward and forward along text positions 
     after search and other operations.
<p>
<li> <i>Mouse control</i> available for all versions (Unix and DOS).
<li> Pull-down <i>menus</i>, 
     flag menus with marked options, 
     and a quick pop-up menu for text-position related functions.
     <br>
     Menu navigation and control with mouse (click / drag or scroll wheel) 
     or keyboard.
     <br>
     Menus structured with subtitles, nice configurable menu appearance.
<li> <i>Scrollbar</i>.
<p>
<li> Configurable visible indications of different line-end types 
     (Unix/DOS/Mac/Unicode line-ends, paragraphs) and TAB characters.
     TAB width can be toggled.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     <i>HTML syntax highlighting</i> distinguishes HTML tags, 
     HTML comments and JSP.
<li> Help function; 
     optional help status line of (shifted) function key assignments.
<li> View only and restricted modes.
<p>
<li>Interactive file chooser for file selection.
<li>Interactive file switcher for tab-like switching between the opened files.
</ul>

<a name=screen>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Screen interaction</h4>
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Perfect responsiveness to terminal/window size changes. On resizing 
     the window, mined will immediately adjust and update its display &ndash; 
     the text cursor position will stay where it was.
     Resizing also works while prompting for input (e.g. search text).
<li> Screen output starting from current position and growing to the 
     top and bottom &ndash; on slow (e.g. remote) terminal connections 
     this gives the user a quick visual focus on the cursor position 
     and provides better orientation when paging or searching.
<li> Display of filename and modification status in window header line and icon.
<li> Automatic adaptation of Backspace and Delete functions to 
     user preference as set in the environment (stty); additional 
     configuration options.
<li> Function key sequences for many common terminal types are always 
     activated (vt100, vt100 application mode, Sun, various xterm 
     settings, Linux console, HP and Iris workstation X windows, PC 
     keyboard). The operating environment that is supposed to handle 
     terminal-specific input setup (termcap/terminfo) is often poorly 
     configured &ndash; with explicitly coded sequences much more function 
     keys can be recognised than other applications can; 
     also in many situations of remote operation the mined approach 
     works better.
     <br>
     Configuration option to select among ambiguous function key sets.
</ul>

<a name=editing>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Text editing features</h4>
<li> Multiple paste buffers (emacs-style).
<li> Optional rectangular copy/paste area, 
     <img align=absmiddle src=new.gif title=2014.24>
     also toggled by using Alt with mouse movement.
<li> Interactive selection highlighting (with mouse or keyboard 
     selection), standard dual-mode Del key behaviour.
<li> Auto-indentation of new lines (cloning white space of current line).
     <br>
     Auto-indentation is automatically suppressed to support unmodified 
     terminal/mouse copy and paste (by heuristic detection of input speed).
<li> Automatic Back Tab function to revert to the previous matching 
     indentation level (“undent” function).
<li> Tab expansion option (expands Tab input to space characters).
<li> Structure input support for indented pairs of parentheses. 
     Also for Javadoc frames.
<li> Word/line wrap with left/right margins and first line indentation.
     (Uses either empty lines or blank/non-blank line ends as paragraph 
     indications.)
     Optional memory of word-wrap margins between mined invocations.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Word/line wrap justification applies auto-indentation with 
     heuristic detection of numbered items and program source comments.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     <img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2015.25>
     Advanced list support for bullet lists and numbered lists.
     Item bullets are repeated, numbering is auto-incremented after 
     item paragraphs (also considering Unicode line separators).
     Undent (smart Backspace) considers list items.
<li> Header line underlining.
<p>
<li> Cross-session paste buffer that enables Copy/Paste between different 
     invocations of mined (also subsequently or remotely, and with some 
     configuration also in a heterogenous network).
<li> Copy/Paste/File write functions with optional append mode.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Optional Unicode paste buffer mode with implicit conversion.
<li> Multiple text position markers.
<li> Marker stack for quick return to previous text positions.
<p>
<li> Input support for HTML tags and attributes (two options).
<li> Case conversion function handles full Unicode range, including 
     special cases (like multiple character mappings, conditional mappings).
     Shift-F3 cycles casing of a word between all small, title case 
     (beginning capital), and all capitals, 
     using Unicode title case characters for the first character when appropriate.
     For Japanese script, it toggles the word between Hiragana and Katakana.
     Unicode-based case mapping is applicable in all text encodings.
<li> Line end type conversion for current line or all lines (Options menu).
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Binary transparency including simultaneous handling of different 
     line end types, null characters, transparent splitting of 
     overlong lines, and transparent handling of illegal UTF-8 sequences.
<li> Optional password hiding, automatically selected with “hidden” files.
<li> Optional emacs command mode.
<li> Optional WordStar command mode.
<li> Optional pico command mode (alpha).
</ul>

<a name=searching>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Search functions</h4>
<li> Search/replace with optional interactive confirmation.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Search and replacement patterns can contain embedded newlines.
<li> Search function for identifier at current cursor position and 
     for identifier definition (using tags file), also across 
     different files, with the option to return to the previous 
     position, even across files.
<li> Search function for matching parenthesis.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Search function for matching HTML tags and matching source 
     program structures.
<li> Repeat function for the two previous search operations.
<li> Startup search expression option on command line.
<li> Startup option for line number positioning.
</ul>

<a name=textfile>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Secure text and file handling</h4>
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif><img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2015.25>
     Transparent editing of encrypted files, 
     using filters configurable by file type.
<li> Consequent prevention of loss of data by mistake or error:
     <ul>
     <li> In any case of file writing or other text saving problem 
          mined will continue the editing session instead of exiting.
     <li> No external file other than the original source of the text 
          being edited will be overwritten without confirmation by any 
          text or buffer save operation.
     <li> No accidental quit without prompting for any unsaved changes.
     <li> In the case of an external interrupt, panic handling saves 
          the text to a panic file if possible.
     </ul>
<li> All file handling errors are reported quoting clear error indications 
     (in contrast to the cryptic messages of many classic Unix tools).
<li> Backup features, supporting simple or versioned backup files.
<li> Hard link preservation of edited files.
</ul>

<a name=other>
<br>
<ul>
<h4>Other useful features</h4>
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Optional memory of last cursor position when a file save command 
     is issued, automatic re-positioning in next editing session.
<li> <img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>
     Integration of version control systems: 
     checkout and checkin commands available from File menu.
<li> Print function that works in all text encodings.
     Uses paps (a Pango printing script) or uniprint (from yudit).
