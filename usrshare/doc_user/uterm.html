<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<dl><dd>
	<dd>Invoke a terminal window with a reasonably optimized range 
	of Unicode support, enforcing UTF-8 mode and using the best 
	Unicode fonts found.
	<dd>Many systems are not yet properly configured to enable 
	easy and straight-forward use of Unicode in a text-mode terminal 
	environment (such as xterm or rxvt).
	The purpose of uterm is to help users to start a terminal 
	with good Unicode capabilities without much hassle.

<h3>Terminal selection</h3>
	Either of xterm or rxvt-unicode is selected as the terminal 
	application to start, depending on:
	<ul>
	<li>Availability of rxvt-unicode: The script checks whether 
	rxvt-unicode is available under the name urxvt (e.g. on 
	cygwin), or if rxvt is available, whether it actually is 
	rxvt-unicode (and not an older version). Only if this check is 
	positive, rxvt is considered.
	<li>User preference, implicit: If the environment variable TERM starts with 
	"rxvt", rxvt-unicode is preferred.
	<li>User preference, explicit: With the command line option 
	<code>-rx</code> or <code>-rxvt</code>, rxvt-unicode is preferred.
	With <code>-xt</code> or <code>-xterm</code>, xterm is preferred.
	<li>Font selection: If the GNU unifont is selected, rxvt is chosen.
	<li>In all other cases, xterm is chosen.
	</ul>
	Users of mlterm are assumed to start mlterm themselves directly, 
	so mlterm is not considered.
	Neither of KDE konsole or gnome-terminal is currently considered 
	since they cannot be font-configured on-the-fly.

<h3>Font selection</h3>
	The uterm script tries its best to use fonts that provide a 
	maximum of Unicode support.
	<ul>
	<li>First it checks if you have the 10x20 Unicode font and a 
	matching 20x20 double width font installed (see explanation below 
	about CJK coverage).
	<li>If not, it checks if you have the 9x18 Unicode font and a 
	matching 18x18 double width font installed and uses them.
	<li>If both are not found, it tries to invoke rxvt with the GNU unifont.
	<li>If either GNU unifont or rxvt are not installed, efont is tried.
	<li>As a last resort, it tries to invoke xterm with 6x13 and 12x13 fonts.
	<li>As a very last fallback, it invokes xterm with its configured default fonts.
	</ul>
	<dd>
	<br><i>Note:</i> The efonts are installed on fewer systems than 
	the misc-fixed fonts so only 1 size of them is considered and at 
	a lower priority. If you prefer efont, you should configure 
	xterm font usage yourself (using X resource configuration) and 
	invoke xterm directly.
	<br><i>Note:</i> GNU unifont does unfortunately not work with xterm 
	(or rather xterm with GNU unifont), so in this case rxvt is invoked.

<h4>Information about font usage</h4>
	Font selection is a matter of both taste and script coverage.
	The uterm script uses fonts with a good coverage of Unicode 
	script ranges, but its order of precedence may not suit your 
	specific needs. In that case you should configure your exact 
	desired font preference and invoke the desired terminal 
	(xterm, rxvt) directly.
	<dd>Coverage of certain scripts would suggest certain font 
	preferences:
	<ul>
	<li>Korean Hangul: GNU unifont
	<li>Devanagari: efont
	<li>Georgian: efont, misc X fonts
	<li><i>(to be continued)</i>
	</ul>

<h4>CJK coverage and the 10x20 fonts</h4>
	Among the Unicode "misc" X fonts (misc-fixed-...), the 20 
	pixel size fonts are much clearer in appearance than the 18 
	pixel fonts for which CJK wide fonts (using double cell width 
	in a fixed-width terminal) are available.
	Unfortunately, xterm is not yet capable of padding an 18x18 
	font up to 20x20 pixel character cells for use together with 
	a 10x20 pixel font.
	<dd>The bdf18to20 script, packaged with the mined editor like 
	uterm, helps with this issue and generates the missing fonts 
	from the 18 pixel double width fonts by padding blank pixels.
	If you have installed those, uterm will select 20 pixel fonts 
	as its first preference.
	<dd>
	<br><i>Note:</i> 20x20 fonts (padded with bdf18to20) are already 
	installed as part of the xterm package with SuSE Linux 10.0.
	<br><i>Note:</i> The 6x13 pixel font from Unicode misc-fixed-... 
	also has a matching 12x13 CJK font but that size is really 
	much too small for serious application on modern desktops which 
	often provide higher resolutions than traditional workstations.

<h3>UTF-8 environment setup</h3>
	<dd>The uterm script enforces UTF-8 mode with the terminal and 
	also sets up the locale variable environment to reflect UTF-8 
	terminal encoding.
	If necessary, all LC_* and LANG environment variables are 
	modified to provide a proper environment for applications started 
	inside the Unicode terminal. (See the inline documentation of 
	the uterm script for how this is done.)

<h3>X resource class</h3>
	When starting xterm, uterm uses the X resource class UXTerm so 
	you can configure the desired appearance of UTF-8 mode 
	terminal windows in your X resource configuration.
	For rxvt-unicode, the class URxvt can be used for X resources.

<h3>Unicode width data version</h3>
	If called with an -e option to invoke a specific program in it, 
	uterm enables the -mk_width option of xterm (if xterm version 201 
	or newer is available).
	This tells xterm to use its own, compiled-in character width 
	property tables, rather than using system locale information.
	The advantage is that this information is often newer (referring 
	to a newer version of Unicode) than the installed system data.
	Thus the user is enabled to use up-to-date Unicode data by 
	using a self-installed copy of xterm, rather than being stuck with 
	the Unicode data that the system administrator cares to install.
	This is especially useful if the application is known to be able to 
	recognise that Unicode version, like the Unicode editor mined.
	The umined script makes use of this feature to invoke mined in 
	a Unicode terminal with a maximum of Unicode support.

<h3>Keyboard resources for application use</h3>
	If called with an -e option to invoke a specific program in it, 
	uterm also enables a number of other xterm resources in order to 
	enable best keyboard and terminal control for applications:
	<dl>
	<dt>*VT100*eightBitOutput:true
	<dd>to enable 8 Bit output (actually not needed in UTF-8 mode)
	<dt>*VT100*metaSendsEscape:true
	<dd>to enable ESC prefixing triggered by Alt-key
	<dt>*VT100*eightBitInput:false
	<dd>to enable ESC prefixing triggered by Alt-key in old xterm versions
	<dt>*VT100*deleteIsDEL:true
	<dd>to enable distinguishing the two DEL keys on the keyboard
	<dt>*utf8Title:true
	<dd>to enable UTF-8 window title strings
	</dl>
