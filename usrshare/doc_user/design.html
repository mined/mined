<h3>Design Principles</h3>

<h4>Simplicity and usefulness</h4>
Mined follows the design philosophy of being simple and intuitive.
That means, users should be enabled to perform the most frequent editing 
tasks without having to study and learn a peculiar interface first.
<br>
This basic approach is supplemented by a good range of text editing 
capabilities including dedicated navigation support as well as 
layout support for plain text and program files.

<h4>Usability</h4>
Unlike other editors that support plain text mode, mined is affirmative 
toward the conveniences of modern user interface paradigms, like 
concise and comprehensive menus, mouse control including mouse wheel 
scrolling, scrollbar navigation.
It does not impose on you the restrictive paradigms and weird 
interactive hassles of editors that evolved from line-oriented tools.

<h4>Internationalisation and legacy support</h4>
For character encoding support, mined has the design philosophy of 
having everything on board so that e.g. CJK display and input methods 
run “out of the box” without any extra configuration and without 
depending on the operating system environment.
This enables Unicode support, character display and input even on old 
systems that do not provide this support themselves.

<h4>Serving as a tool</h4>
Mined design claims that an editor should be a tool providing the 
best usage value for daily editing tasks. It should not be 
an editing system that defines a “way of life” with peculiarities and 
setup hassles.
