<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<dl>
	<dd>Mined is a text editor with

	<dd>
<span summary>
	<h4>Security and safety features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Transparent editing of encrypted files, 
		using filters configurable by file type
	<li>Systematic text and file handling safety, avoiding loss of data
	<li>Backup features, supporting simple or versioned backup
	<li>Hard link preservation
	<li>Optional password hiding
	</ul>

	<h4>Interactive features</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Intuitive user interface

		(without ancient line-end handling limitations or insert/append confusion)
	<li>Supports various control styles:
	<ul>
		<li>Editing with command control, function key control, or menu control
		<li>Navigation by cursor keys, control keys, mouse or scrollbar
	</ul>
	<li>Concise and comprehensive menus (driven by keyboard or mouse)
	<li><i>HOP</i> key paradigm doubles the number of navigation functions 
		that can be most easily reached and remembered by 
		intuitively amplifying or expanding the associated function
	<li>Interactive file chooser and interactive file switcher
	<li>Proper handling of window size changes in any state of interaction
	</ul>

	<h4>Versatile character encoding support</h4>
	<ul>

		mechanisms to specify both text and terminal encodings 
		with useful precedences
	<li>Flexible combination of any text encoding with any terminal encoding
	<li>Encoding support tested with: xterm, mlterm, rxvt, 
		cxterm, kterm, hanterm,

		&ndash; even subsequent or remote &ndash; invocations of mined)
	<li>Optional Unicode paste buffer mode with implicit conversion
	<li>Marker stack for quick return to previous text positions
	<li>Multiple paste buffers (emacs-style)
	<li>Optional rectangular copy/paste area
	<li>Interactive selection highlighting (with mouse or keyboard selection), 
		standard dual-mode Del key behaviour
	<li>Program editing features, HTML support and syntax highlighting, 
		identifier and function definition search, also across files; 
		structure input support
	<li>Visible indications of special text contents 
		(TAB characters, different line-end types, character 
		codes that cannot be displayed in the current mode)
	<li>Full binary transparent editing with visible indications 
		(illegal UTF-8 or CJK, mixed line end types, NUL characters, ...)
	<li>Print function that works in all text encodings
	<li>Optional emacs command mode
	</ul>

	<h4>Small-footprint operation, portability and interworking</h4>
	<ul>

		<br>
		Synonym of <code class=option>-EU</code>.
<dt><code class=option>-l</code>	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Interprets edited text as Latin-1, 
		disables UTF and CJK auto detection.
		<br>
		Synonym of <code class=option>-EL</code>.
<dt><code class=option>+u-u</code>	<i>(character handling)</i>
	<dd>	Interpret text as UTF-8, but interpret Unicode line 
		separator and paragraph separator as normal 
		characters, not line ends.
<dt><code class=option>-c</code>	<i>(character handling)</i>
	<dd>	Selects separated display mode for combined characters 
		(separating base character and combining characters).
		This mode can also be toggled from the Options menu or

		character encoding flag) in the flags area.
<dt><code class=option>-b</code>	<i>(character handling)</i>
	<dd>	Toggle <a href=#righttoleft>"poor man's bidi" mode</a>: 
		input support for right-to-left scripts, based on

		is disabled by default.)
<a name=encodingoption></a>
<dt><code class=option>-E</code>X	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Where X is one of B/G/C/J/S/K/H: Selects one of the 
		supported CJK character encodings for text interpretation 
		and disables auto-detection of CJK encodings.
		For details, see <a href=#cjkencoding>CJK encoding support</a>.

		<a href=#encodingflags>Character encoding flags</a> listing 
		in the <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> section.
<dt><code class=option>-E</code>X	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Where X is one of U/L or another 1-letter character 
		encoding tag: Selects Unicode/UTF-8, Latin-1, or one 
		of the other supported character encodings for 
		text interpretation.
		For details on supported encodings, see the 
		<a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> listing.
<dt><code class=option>-E=</code>charmap	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Where charmap is a character encoding name (as 
		reported by the <code>locale charmap</code> command):
		Selects the respective character encoding for 
		text interpretation.
		For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
		see <a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
<dt><code class=option>-E.</code>suffix	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Where suffix is a character encoding suffix ("codeset") 
		as used in locale names:
		Selects the respective character encoding for 
		text interpretation.
		For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
		see <a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
<dt><code class=option>-E:</code>flag	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Where flag is a 2-letter indication used by mined to 
		indicate the respective text encoding in the Encoding flag:
		Selects the respective character encoding for 
		text interpretation.
		For details on supported encodings and their flags, 
		see the <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> listing.
<dt><code class=option>-Eu</code>	<i>(buffer encoding)</i>
	<dd>	Enables Unicode buffer mode which always maintains the 
		Copy/Paste buffer in Unicode, thus facilitating conversion 
		between different encodings being edited.
		For details, see <a href=#unicodebuffer>
		Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion</a>.
<dt><code class=option>-E?</code>	<i>(character set)</i>
	<dd>	Determine the encoding(s) of the text file(s) given 
		as parameters by auto-detection, print out the 
		information and quit.
<dt><code class=option>-E</code> <i>or</i> <code class=option>-E-</code>
	<dd>	Disable text encoding auto-detection and derive it 
		from the locale environment.
<a name=optionK></a>
<dt><code class=option>-K</code>X	<i>(input method handling)</i>
	<dd>	Configure the Space key to perform a certain function 
		in keyboard mapping selection menus 
		("CJK input method pick lists"), where X is one of:
		'n' to navigate to the next choice (like cursor-right), 
		'r' to navigate to the next row (like cursor-down), 
		's' to select the current choice (like Enter).
<dt><code class=option>-K=</code>im-im	<i>(input method selection)</i>
	<dd>	Select input method and/or standby input method (for 
		quick switching with Alt-k).
		The syntax is the same as for the optional environment 
		variable <a href=#MINEDKEYMAP><span class=env>MINEDKEYMAP</span></a> (see below).
</dl></dl>

<h3>	Terminal mode</h3>
<dl><dd><dl compact>
<dt><code class=option>-U</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Toggles UTF-8 screen handling assumption, i.e. selects 
		UTF-8 screen handling unless UTF-8 keyboard input is 
		already selected (by another <code class=option>-U</code> 
		option or environment setting).
		In the latter case, <code class=option>-U</code> 
		deselects UTF-8 terminal operation.
		This option should normally not be used as the mode should 
		be configured in the environment (see 
		<a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>).
<dt><code class=option>+U</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Selects UTF-8 screen handling.
		Note that none of the options <code class=option>-U</code> 
		or <code class=option>+U</code> needs to be used if 
		the environment is correctly configured to indicate 
		UTF-8 as it should (see <a href=#unicodeenv>
		Unicode handling / Terminal environment</a>).
		<br>
		Also, mined performs auto-detection of UTF-8 terminal 
		encoding and UTF-8 terminal features (different width 
		data versions, handling of double-width, combining and 
		joining characters), so even if the environment is 
		not correctly configured, mined should work without 
		this explicit terminal mode parameter.
<dt><code class=option>+UU</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Selects <a href=#bidi>bidirectional terminal support</a>. 
		This mode implies UTF-8 and also assumes that Arabic 
		ligature joining (of LAM/ALEF combinations) is 
		applied; it will be handled by mined accordingly.
<dt><code class=option>+UU-U</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Selects <a href=#bidi>bidirectional terminal support</a> 
		without Arabic ligature joining (like mintty).
<dt><code class=option>-cc</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Assumes that the terminal does not support combining characters.
		By default &ndash; unless otherwise detected &ndash; mined assumes 
		that combining characters work on UTF-8 terminals and 
		do not work in CJK terminals.
<dt><code class=option>+c</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Assumes that the terminal supports combining characters.
		This is enabled by default for UTF-8 terminals, and 
		disabled by default for CJK terminals, unless otherwise 
		detected.
<a name=termencodingoption></a>
<dt><code class=option>+E</code>X	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where X is one of B/G/C/J/X/S/x/K/H: Assumes a CJK encoded 
		terminal in one of the supported CJK character encodings.
		For details, see <a href=#cjkencoding>CJK encoding support</a>.
<dt><code class=option>+E</code>X	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where X is one of g/c/j: Assumes a CJK encoded terminal 
		in one of the CJK character encodings like G/C/J and 
		also assumes that the terminal cannot display GB18030 
		4-byte encodings, CNS 4-byte encodings, EUC-JP 3-byte 
		encodings, respectively.
<dt><code class=option>+E</code>X	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where X is one of U/L or another 1-letter character 
		encoding tag: Assumes a Unicode/UTF-8 or Latin-1 
		encoded terminal, respectively, or an 8-bit terminal 
		running one of the other supported character encodings.
		For details on supported encodings, see the 
		<a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> listing.
		For details on terminal encoding support, see 
		<a href=#terminalencoding>Terminal encoding support</a>.
<dt><code class=option>+E=</code>charmap	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where charmap is a character encoding name (as 
		reported by the <code>locale charmap</code> command):
		Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
		For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
		see <a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
<dt><code class=option>+E.</code>suffix	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where suffix is a character encoding suffix ("codeset") 
		as used in locale names:
		Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
		For details on locale-related character encoding configuration, 
		see <a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
<dt><code class=option>+E:</code>flag	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Where flag is a 2-letter indication used by mined to 
		indicate the respective encoding as text encoding in 
		the Encoding flag:
		Assumes the terminal to have the respective encoding.
		For details on supported encodings and their flags, 
		see the <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> listing.
<dt><code class=option>+E?</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Determine the terminal encoding and further terminal 
		encoding features and properties by auto-detection, 
		print out the information and quit.
<dt><code class=option>-C</code>	<i>(character set and terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	(Deprecated.)
		Turns a subsequent <code class=option>-E</code> option 
		(with a single-letter CJK tag) effectively into a 
		combined <code class=option>-E</code> and 
		<code class=option>+E</code> option.
		So mined assumes the given CJK encoding for both 
		terminal encoding (unless overridden by UTF-8 terminal 
		auto-detection) and text encoding.
		Can be used for quick indication of CJK terminals 
		(e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm) if locale environment 
		is not properly set.
<dt><code class=option>+C</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Displays unknown characters on CJK terminal:
		Assumes a CJK encoded terminal (e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm; 
		more specific encoding specification is advisable), and 
		characters encoded in a CJK encoding format are 
		displayed transparently even if they do not map to a 
		valid Unicode character.
<dt><code class=option>+CC</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Displays invalid characters on CJK terminal:
		Implies <code class=option>+C</code>, but even 
		character codes that do not match the encoding scheme 
		(e.g. wrt. to specified byte ranges) are written 
		transparently to the terminal.
<dt><code class=option>+CCC</code>	<i>(terminal mode)</i>
	<dd>	Displays extended characters on CJK terminal:
		Implies <code class=option>+CC</code> and overrides 
		auto-detection of the terminal capability to display 
		CJK 3-byte / 4-byte codes which would by default 
		suppress their display if the terminal does not support them.
<dt><code class=option>+D</code>	<i>(keyboard assignment)</i>
	<dd>	Setup xterm (by sending dynamic configuration codes) to 
		apply two useful keyboard handling modes:
		Del key on small keypad sends DEL character rather 
		than an escape sequence and can thus be distinguished 
		from the Del key on the big (numeric) keypad.
		Prepend ESC to character if pressed with the Alt or Meta 
		key in order to enable Alt-commands (e.g. Alt-f to 
		open the file menu, Alt-Shift-H to enter HTML markers etc).
		(Unfortunately this cannot be done by default as it cannot 
		be undone because the previous state cannot be detected.)
		(This xterm setting should rather be configured permanently 
		as suggested in the sample file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> 
		in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.)
<dt><code class=option>+#</code>
	<dd>	Assume dark terminal background and adjust some colours 
		accordingly.
<dt><code class=option>-nc</code>
	<dd>	Suppress usage of terminal colour attributes.
</dl></dl>

<h3>	Information display</h3>
<dl><dd><dl compact>
<dt><code class=option>+H</code>
	<dd>	Enable syntax highlighting for HTML/XML and server scripting.
<dt><code class=option>-H</code>
	<dd>	Disable HTML/XML syntax highlighting.
<dt><code class=option>+?c</code>
	<dd>	Enable character code information display on status line.
<dt><code class=option>+?</code>X
	<dd>	Enable character code information display (implies +?c) 
		with additional information, where X is one of:
		<ul>
		<li>s: Unicode script
		<li>n: Unicode character name
		<li>q: Unicode named sequence
		<li>d: Unicode character decomposition
		<li>m: mined input mnemonics available for this character
		</ul>
		Note: setting any of these options may disable some others 
		as not all combinations are considered useful.
<dt><code class=option>+?h</code>
	<dd>	Enable full Han character information display as a popup.
		In addition to the character description, a set of 
		pronunciations can be selected with the variable <span class=env>MINEDHANINFO</span>.
<dt><code class=option>+?x</code>
	<dd>	Enable compact Han character information on status line.
		In addition to the character description, a set of 
		pronunciations can be selected with the variable <span class=env>MINEDHANINFO</span>.
<dt><code class=option>+?f</code>
	<dd>	Enable file and position information display on status line 
		(enabled by default).
		Note that when editing a file that does not fit 
		completely in memory (e.g. large file on old system), 
		this option may cause considerable swapping. In that 
		case, disable the feature with <code class=option>-?f</code>.
<dt><code class=option>-?</code>X
	<dd>	Deselect the respective <code class=option>+?</code> option.

<h3>	Editing behaviour</h3>
<dl><dd><dl compact>
<dt><code class=option>-q</code>
	<dd>
		Derive quotation marks style from locale information 
		(environment variables LANGUAGE, TEXTLANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG).
		See <a href=#smartquotes>Smart quotes</a> for details.
		Note: if either LANGUAGE or TEXTLANG is used, 
		<code class=option>-q</code> is assumed implicitly.
<dt><code class=option>-q=</code>locale
	<dd>
		Derive quotation marks style from given locale.
		(<code class=option>-q:</code>locale works too.)
<dt><code class=option>+q</code> <i>or</i> <code class=option>+q=</code>locale
	<dd>
		Like -q but exchange primary and secondary style.
<dt><code class=option>-q:</code>style
	<dd>
		Set given quotation marks style if available for any language,
		e.g. <code class=option>-q:"«»"</code>.
		(<code class=option>-q=</code>style works too.)
<dt><code class=option>-w</code>
	<dd>	Recognise fewer places as word boundaries for word skip 
		and delete commands.
<dt><code class=option>-a</code>
	<dd>	Append mode: Append to text buffer or external file for 
		copy/delete commands instead of replacing it.
<dt><code class=option>+j</code>
	<dd>	Set justification level 1 (or increment level 
		previously set by environment variable to 1 or 2):
		Level 1 initially enables automatic word wrap at line 
		end when typing over right margin.
		Can be changed by clicking on the j/J flag.
<dt><code class=option>+jj</code>
	<dd>	Set justification level 2:
		Level 2 initially enables automatic word wrap at line 
		end when typing within paragraph; buggy.
		Can be changed by clicking on the j/J flag.
<dt><code class=option>-j</code>
	<dd>	Set justification level 1 or 2 (other than previously 
		set).
		Can be changed by clicking on the j/J flag.
<dt><code class=option>-T</code>
	<dd>	When moving vertically over a Tab character, stay 
		left of the Tab column range (on the Tab character).
		The default depends on the previous position.
		Also, stay left on a wide character when moving 
		vertically over it.
<dt><code class=option>+T</code>
	<dd>	When moving vertically over a Tab character, stay right of 
		the Tab column range (behind the Tab character).
		The default depends on the previous position.
<dt><code class=option>-V</code>
	<dd>	Place cursor before pasted region after paste commands.
		(If this option is enabled already, -V acts like -VV.)
<dt><code class=option>-VV</code>
	<dd>	Like -V, and disable emacs-style paste buffer 
		functions for "delete word" and "delete to end of 
		line" commands (^T, ^K).
<dt><code class=option>+V</code>
	<dd>	Place cursor behind pasted region after paste commands.
		(If this option is enabled already, +V acts like +VV.)
<dt><code class=option>+VV</code>
	<dd>	Like +V, and enable emacs-style paste buffer functions 
		for "delete word" and "delete to end of line" commands 
		(^T, ^K).
<dt><code class=option>+[</code>
	<dd>	Initially enable rectangular paste buffer mode.
		See <a href=#rectangular>Rectangular copy/paste</a>.
<dt><code class=option>-[</code>

		</ul>
</dl></dl>

<h3>	Keyboard function mode selection</h3>
<dl><dd><dl compact>
<dt><code class=option>+e</code>X
	<dd>	Select emulation mode, especially control key function 
		mapping, where X is one of
		<ul>
		<li>e: <a href=#emacs>emacs mode</a>
		<li>s: <a href=#wordstar>WordStar mode</a>
		<li>w: <a href=#windowskb>Windows keyboard mode</a>
		<li>W: Windows behaviour (keyboard mode, CRLF for new files, cmd.exe with ESC !)
		<li>p: pico mode
		<li>m: mined default
		</ul>
<dt><code class=option>-e</code>
	<dd>	Select <a href=#emacs>emacs mode</a>. This assigns 
		functions to control keys, M-X commands (ESC commands, 
		using the "meta" key as emacs calls the Alt prefix) 
		and C-X commands as defined by the emacs editor. Also 
		the emacs paste buffer ring and cut/paste behaviour is 
		enabled.
<dt><code class=option>-W</code>
	<dd>	Select <a href=#wordstar>WordStar mode</a>. This 
		configures WordStar command key layout and enables 
		many functions of the ^K, ^O, and ^Q menus.
<dt><code class=option>-k</code>X
	<dd>	Select <a href=#selection>keypad modes</a>, where X is one of
		<ul>
		<li>m: mined keypad mode.
		<li>s <i>or</i> S: Shift-select mode:
			Shifted keypad keys (cursor keys, PgUp/PgDn/Home/End)
			start or extend text selection (with visual 
			highlighting) and visual selection behaviour is 
			slightly adapted to common usage; in addition, 
			Shift-HOP is mapped to the Copy function.
			Unshifted keypad keys retain their default mined functions.
		<li>w: Windows keypad mode; implies <code class=option>-kS</code> 
			(also implied by <code class=option>+ew</code>):
		<li>c: Home and End keys of small ("editing") keypad invoke 
		Mark/Copy to paste buffer (overriding selected mode for them)
		<li>C: Home and End keys of big ("numeric") keypad invoke 
		Mark/Copy to paste buffer (overriding selected mode for them)
		</ul>
<dt><code class=option>+t</code>
	<dd>	(Deprecated.) Windows keypad mode, like <code class=option>-kw</code>.
<dt><code class=option>+tt</code>
	<dd>	(Deprecated.) Shift-select mode, like <code class=option>-kS</code>.
<dt><code class=option>-k</code> <i>(as single-letter option)</i>
	<dd>	Switch the Home and End key functions of the two 
		keypads (small keypad, numeric keypad), i.e. exchange 
		the two keypads with respect to these keys.
		This assigns the more usual functions "goto line 
		beginning", "goto line end" to the Home and End keys 
		of the right keypad.
		The (assumedly more useful) mined default is to assign 
		the frequently used paste buffer functions (mark, 
		copy) to these keys.
		<br>In turn, the assigned functions of the Home and End keys 
		of the small keypad ("editing keypad") are exchanged to 
		provide the other function than on the right keypad, 
		respectively - provided the terminal and its configuration 
		support this distinction.
		<br>Also Alt-Home/End are assigned the respective other 
		functions on each keypad so the most useful keypad 
		functions should always be quite easily available.
		<br>Regardless of this switching, mined tries to map 
		fixed functions to modified Home and End keys:
		Ctrl-Home/End for line begin/end movement (both keypads), 
		Shift-Home/End for the paste buffer copy functions 
		(small keypad) - provided the terminal, its mode and 
		configuration support distinction of modified keypad keys.
		<br>See also the section on <a href=#keylayout>Keypad layout</a> 
		for a motivating overview of the mined keypad 
		assignment features and options.
		<br>About terminal support and configuration, see 
		<a href=#keyconf>Keypad configuration</a> for further hints.
<dt><code class=option>+k</code>
	<dd>	Enforce usage of terminal "keypad mode" which switches 
		the numeric keypad to send "application keypad" escape 
		sequences. This is normally not needed. On certain 
		terminals, mined will automatically use this mode (e.g. 
		Linux console), and in terminal emulators it is usually 
		not needed unless you are running a misconfigured 
		X windows system in which case you can enable 
		distinguished keypad functions by using the NumLock 
		function of the keyboard and switching on this option.
<dt><code class=option>+Bp</code>
	<dd>	Backspace should apply "plain backspacing" rather than 
		"smart backspacing", i.e. no auto-undent and only delete 
		one combining character of a combined character;
		without this option, use Control-Backspace for the "plain" function;
		with this option, use Shift-Control-Backspace for the "smart" function.
<dt><code class=option>-B</code>
	<dd>	(Deprecated.)
		Enforce the Del control character to delete left, 
		Backspace to move left.
		Should normally not be used, see 
		<a href=#backspaceadaptation>
		"Automatic backspace mode adaptation"</a> below.

		<li>b: transparent menu background
		<li>p: plain menu borders (no lines)

	<dd>	Further restrict usage of graphic characters: 
		no graphic characters (including VT100 graphics) 
		for menu borders.
<dt><code class=option>-F</code>
	<dd>	Assume a screen font with limited coverage of special 
		symbols and restrict usage of special marker 
		characters for display of line indications. (This is 
		needed e.g. for KDE konsole or for xterm using 
		TrueType fonts.)
		<br>Interpretation of the <span class=env>MINEDUTF</span>* environment variables is suppressed.
<dt><code class=option>-FF</code>
	<dd>	Assume a screen font with even more limited coverage 
		of special symbols and restrict usage of special characters 
		for indication of selected menu items.
		Also, trigger substitution display of a number of special 
		characters in text (like in non-Unicode terminals).
<dt><code class=option>+F</code>
	<dd>	Revert the effect of one <code class=option>-F</code>

<h2>Editing text with mined</h2>
<dl><dd>
	Mined is always in insert mode. Commands are single control 
	characters, double key commands starting with ESCAPE, and a 
	collection of function keys (for various types of keyboards and 
	terminals). As a specialty, note the prefixing 'HOP KEY' which 
	amplifies or expands the effect of certain commands "just as 
	you would expect"; this provides for more command flexibility 
	without having to remember too many keys. It is described in a 
	separate section below.

<a name=keylayout></a>
<h3>	Keypad layout</h3>
	Control key layout for basic movement functions is topographic 
	on the left-hand side of the keyboard (an idea originating 
	from early editors, when keyboards didn't have cursor keypads).
	(Although using a cursor block is more comfortable, a simple 
	set of control key assignments is useful as a fallback on 
	terminals or remote connections with reduced functionality.)
	<p>
	The right-hand cursor block of typical keyboards is assigned 
	the most important movement and paste buffer functions.
	<dl>
	<dt><b>Keypad assignment features:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Mined optimizes keypad usage for most frequently used functions, 
	especially <i>paste buffer functions</i> in addition to 
	<i>navigation functions</i>, by making them easily accessible on 
	the keypad.
	<ul>
		<li>For this purpose, mined distinguished between 
		Home/End keys on the numeric keypad and on the small 
		keypad (whenever possible with the terminal) in order 
		to avoid the waste of resources by the usually redundant 
		mapping of these two keypad blocks.
		<li>Note: this means that on the big ("numeric") keypad 
		the mined keypad function assignment for Home/End deviates 
		from their more usual meanings.
		This is deliberately designed to enhance support of 
		quick copy/paste with these easily reachable keys, 
		while line movement can also easily be achieved with 
		HOP cursor-left or HOP cursor-right, respectively.
		<br>This keypad function assignment gives you the 
		<i>best benefit of keypad usage</i> and is thus considered 
		much more useful than the "standard assignment".
		<li>The Del and Backarrow keys perform their usual 
		dual-mode function; if a visual selection is active, 
		they delete the selection (with a Cut to the paste 
		buffer), if there is no visual selection, they delete 
		the next or previous character, respectively.

	<dt>See <a href=#hop>The HOP function</a> below for alternative keys to trigger it.
	<li>Mined offers additional function mappings for modified 
	keypad keys, both for providing unambiguous mappings in any 
	case and to handle the deviation of its benefit-optimized 
	Home/End keypad mapping from frequent expectations, and an 
	option to customize Home/End:
	<ul>
		<li>Alt-Home/End are mapped to the Home/End functions 
		of the other keypad, respectively. So by default, on 
		the numeric keypad they invoke the line navigation 
		functions.
		<li>The <code class=option>-k</code> option exchanges 
		Home/End functions of the small and numeric keypads  
		with each other, and switches Alt-Home/End to also 
		invoke the "other" function, respectively:
		keypad function assignments:

		<li><i>(cf Windows keypad mode below)</i> 
		Ctrl-Del is always mapped to character deletion, 
		while Shift-Del is mapped to the paste buffer Cut function, 
		regardless of the visual selection.
		<li><i>(cf Windows keypad mode below)</i> 
		Ctrl-Home/End are always mapped to line 
		navigation, while Shift-Home/End are mapped to the 
		paste buffer functions Mark/Copy, regardless of the 
		<code class=option>-k</code> option.
		<li>Alt-Del is mapped to the respective "other" function, 
		depending on visual selection.

		<li><i>Note:</i> Keypad function assignments as 
		described depend on terminal support to distinguish 
		all involved keys and modifiers which is unfortunately 
		not always the case.
		<br>Terminal support for proper distinction of 
		different keypads and modified keys may be enhanced by 
		appropriate terminal configuration, see the section 
		on <a href=mined.html#keyconf>Keypad configuration</a>.
		<br>With xterm since 280, all desired distinctions between 
		different keypads as well as modified keypad keys are 
		achieved (by using the modifyKeyboard resource mode in 
		combination with VT220 Keyboard and Application Keypad modes).
	</ul>
	<li>Two <a href=#selection>Keypad modes</a> (see below) change the 
	function assignment of the keypads.
	<ul>
	<li>In Shift-select mode (option <code class=option>-kS</code>), 
	Shift-modified keypad keys activate or extend a visual text selection;
	also Shift-5 <i>(on keypad)</i> performs Copy to paste buffer.
	<li>In Windows keypad mode (option <code class=option>-kw</code>), 
	additionally non-shifted keypad keys are changed to perform the 
	more common functions, at the price of losing the easy Home/End 
	assignment to invoke Mark/Copy to paste buffer (which can however 
	be overridden with options <code class=option>-kc</code> and <code class=option>-kC</code>).
	See <a href=#selection>Keypad modes</a> below for an overview.
	</ul>

<h3>	The HOP function</h3>
	This function, triggered by any of the HOP keys, amplifies or 
	expands functions as listed below. To achieve the combined 
	function, first press any key that is assigned the HOP function, 
	then any key assigned the base function from the table below.
	<br><i>Note:</i> To enable using the HOP function also on 
	keyboards that do not support the keypad "5" or "*" keys (e.g. 
	small notebooks without numeric keypad), a few alternative HOP 
	keys are provided:
	Control-Q, Shift-TAB, the Menu or Windows keys (if running Linux), 
	or (providing a dual-mode function) the Control-G and ESC keys.

	While a pull-down or pop-up menu is open, any HOP key or the 
	Space key or the middle mouse button toggles the HOP 
	amplifier/expander for a function subsequently invoked in the 
	menu; the menu redisplays with function names changed where 
	applicable.

<h3>	Character-oriented navigation and editing</h3>
	From the traditional restriction of Unix tools to the line as a 
	unit of operation, other editors are stuck in a line-oriented 
	movement and insertion paradigm which implies some weird and 
	counter-intuitive behaviour.
<br>	Mined handles the end-of-line position like any ordinary 
	character during movement and editing operations.
	Also search and replacement strings can contain line ends.

<a name=mousemenus></a>
<h3>	Mouse control and menus</h3>
	All versions of mined (Unix, DOS/Windows) support mouse operation.
<br>	Mouse control operates on pull-down and pop-up menus, flags, 
	the text area, the bottom line, and the scroll bar, 
	in order to provide the most useful functions and menu-driven 
	command selection at hand.

<h3>	Menus</h3>
	Mined provides three kinds of menus, all can be opened with 
	either mouse clicks or commands.
	The menus offer the most important editing functions (apart 
	from simple movement).
	Some menus have their items grouped into sections, some of which 
	have subtitles.
	<br>The HOP flag can be toggled while a menu is open with any 
	of the HOP key, ^G, Space, or the middle mouse button.
	When a pull-down menu is opened with the middle mouse button, 
	the HOP variation is initially triggered, offering the HOP 
	variations of the menu items.
	<br>The three menu groups are used as follows:
	<dl>
	<ul>
	<li>A <i>pull-down menu</i> is opened by clicking the mouse 
	on the menu header (in the left part of the top screen line) 
	or scrolling the mouse wheel on this header.
	<br><i>Shortcut:</i> Each pull-down menu can also be opened 
	with ESC or Alt and the small initial letter of the menu 
	header (Alt-f or ESC f for the file menu etc.).
	<li>A <i>flag menu</i> is opened by clicking the 
	right mouse button on a flag indication in the flags area 
	(right part of the top screen line) 
	or scrolling the mouse wheel on it.
	The flag menus have optional markers in front of each item 
	showing which items are currently active.
	<br><i>Shortcut:</i> The Info menu, Input Method (Keyboard 
	Mapping) menu, Smart Quotes menu, Encoding menu can also be 
	opened with Alt-F10, Alt-I, Alt-K, Alt-Q, or Alt-E, respectively 
	(or use an ESC prefix instead of an Alt- modifier respectively).
	<li>The <i>pop-up menu</i> is placed above the text area and 
	can be opened with a right-click or Alt-Space (ESC Space).
	</ul>
	</dl>

<h4>Menu navigation</h4>
	When a menu is open, the cursor-left or cursor-right keys 
	cycle through the pull-down and flag menus.
	Alt-cursor-left and Alt-cursor-right navigate quickly between 
	the two sets of menus (pull-down or flag menus).
	<br>When a submenu is open, cursor-left goes back to the 
	parent menu, cursor-right opens its next menu to the right.
<p>	<dl>There are three methods to navigate within a menu:
	<ul>
	<li>With the keyboard: open menu as described above, navigate 
	with cursor keys or by typing the first letter of the desired 
	menu item (which cycles through all items starting with that 
	letter, or containing a word starting with that letter);
	activate menu item with Enter key.
	<li>With mouse clicks: open menu with click (and release) 
	mouse button, switch to other menu with another click, click 
	on item to activate it. The mouse wheel may be used to navigate 
	menu items.
	<li>With mouse dragging: open menu with mouse button (left or 
	right), browse menus and items with button held down, activate 
	selected item with releasing mouse button.
	</ul>
	Methods may be mixed, e.g. open a menu with either mouse click 
	or keyboard, navigate with mouse wheel, then select with Enter.
	<p>When selecting a menu item, in most cases the associated function 
	is carried out and the menu closed afterwards.
	In some cases, an option is toggled and the menu stays open 
	(esp. in Info menu: Han info pronunciation selection, 
	character information "with" attributes selection).

	</dl>
	</dl>
	<dl><dd>
<p>	<i>Scrollable menus:</i> In a low-height terminal (e.g. 24 lines), 
	longer menus (especially the Encoding menu and the Input Method 
	menu) may not fit on the terminal. All menus are scrollable 
	with cursor keys, including Page Down/Up, Home, End keys.
	<br>When the window size is changed, open menus are closed in 
	order to prevent resizing and repositioning problems; this is 
	planned to be enhanced in a future version.

<h4>Hints</h4>
<p>	<i>Note:</i> Your mouse driver or Windows system may be 
	configured to generate multiple (e.g. 3) mouse wheel events on 
	one mouse wheel movement (e.g. with Windows). An option 
	<code class=option>-L1</code> could compensate for that 
	scaling (as mined applies a mouse wheel factor by itself which 
	is 3 by default).
<p>	<i>Layout configuration:</i> See <a href=#menudisp>Menu 
	display</a> below for configuration of menu appearance.
<p>	<i>Configuration hint:</i> On Unix, in order to make Alt work 
	as a modifier, set the xterm resource metaSendsEscape to true 
	and the rxvt resource meta8 to false as suggested in the 
	example file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	(With older versions of xterm, setting eightBitInput to false 
	may be required instead; this xterm option doesn't actually 
	disable 8 bit input as its name might suggest.)
	With xterm, this setting can also be enforced dynamically with 
	the <code class=option>+D</code> option.

<a name=pastebuffers></a>
<h3>	Interoperable and multiple paste buffers</h3>

<h4>	System paste buffer / Clipboard</h4>
	In the Windows/cygwin version, Shift-Ins inserts the Windows 
	clipboard rather than the mined paste buffer. Copy to paste 
	buffer always fills paste buffer and the clipboard, too.
	In this case, the lineend type is not copied from the clipboard 
	(i.e. typically CRLF) but adapted to the current line.

<h4>	Inter-window paste buffer</h4>
	Mined can perform copy/paste operations within different 
	editing sessions (parallel or subsequent invocations of mined): 
	The command HOP Ins (e.g. ^G ^P) will insert the most 
	recent paste buffer copied or cut in any of the user's mined 
	sessions.
	This can also work remotely in a network; to configure this 
	features, see 
	<a href=#bufferconf>Common paste buffer configuration</a>.

<h4>	Multiple paste buffers</h4>
	Mined provides emacs-style multiple paste buffers that 
	are organised as a buffer ring. Every buffer cut or copy 
	operation (that places the text between the marked and the 
	current position to the buffer) creates a new buffer and 
	stacks it to the list of buffers.
	If the feature "deleted word/line appends to buffer" is enabled 
	(<code class=option>+VV</code>) the commands delete-end-of-line 
	(^K), delete-word (^T) and delete-end-of-sentence (currently 
	emacs mode only) append to the top buffer (disabled with the 
	option <code class=option>-VV</code>).
	<br>
	To paste a non-top-most buffer, paste the most recent buffer 
	first as usual, then use the buffer-ring command 
	(Alt-Ins or Ctrl-F4, or M-y in emacs mode) to 
	exchange the pasted text with the previous buffer. This 
	can be repeated, going down the stack of buffers, and at 
	its bottom, starting over from the top again.

<a name=selection></a>
<h3>	Keypad modes and Visual selection</h3>
	Mined highlights text selection visually, with both 
	mouse selection and keyboard selection.
<h4>Keypad modes</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>In Shift-select mode (enabled with option <code class=option>-kS</code>), 
	Shift-modified keypad keys start or extend visual text selection;
	otherwise the keypad functions are not modified, so that e.g. 
	the useful quick Mark/Copy selection with Home/End keys can 
	still be used.
	<br><i>Note:</i> terminal support to report Shift-modified 
	cursor keys is required to enable this feature.
	<br>The option adjusts some other interactive responses as well 
	to match common selection practice:
	<ul>
	<li>auto-copy (after click-and-drag) is disabled
	<li>Shift-mouse-left-click extends the selection (if supported by terminal)
	<li>mouse-right-click does not extend the selection 
	before opening the menu
	<li>in addition, Shift-HOP is mapped to the Copy function
	</ul>
	Shift selection keypad functions are as follows:
	<dl><dd><table class=ex>
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Left
		<td>	select character left
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Right
		<td>	select character right
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-Left
		<td>	select word left
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-Right
		<td>	select word right
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Up
		<td>	select line up
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Down
		<td>	select line down
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-Up
		<td>	select to previous beginning of paragraph
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-Down
		<td>	select to next beginning of paragraph
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Home
		<td>	select to beginning of line
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-End
		<td>	select to end of line
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-Home
		<td>	select to beginning of text
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-Control-End
		<td>	select to end of text
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-PgUp
		<td>	select to previous page
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-PgDn
		<td>	select to next page
	<tr valign=top><td>Shift-5 <i>(on keypad)</i>
		<td>	copy selected text to paste buffer
	</table></dl>
	<li>In Windows keypad mode 
	(enabled with option <code class=option>-kw</code>, also 
	implied by Windows emulation option <code class=option>+ew</code>),
	additionally non-shifted keypad keys are changed to perform the 
	more common functions, at the price of losing the easy Home/End 
	assignment to invoke Mark/Copy to paste buffer (which can however 
	be overridden with options <code class=option>-kc</code> for the 
	small ("editing") keypad and <code class=option>-kC</code> for the 
	big ("numeric") keypad).
	Also, some Control-modified keys change their function 
	assignment to match more common usage.
	<br>Keypad functions include the Shift selection functions above 
	and add the following functions:
	<dl><dd><table class=ex>
	<tr valign=top><td>Home
		<td>	move cursor to previous beginning of line
	<tr valign=top><td>End
		<td>	move cursor to next end of line
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Left
		<td>	move cursor to previous beginning of word
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Right
		<td>	move cursor to next end of word
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Up
		<td>	move cursor to previous beginning of paragraph
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Down
		<td>	move cursor to next beginning of paragraph
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Home
		<td>	move cursor to beginning of text
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-End
		<td>	move cursor to end of text
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Backarrow
		<td>	delete word left
	<tr valign=top><td>Control-Del
		<td>	delete word right
	<tr valign=top><td>HOP Control-Backarrow
		<td>	delete to beginning of line
	<tr valign=top><td>HOP Control-Del
		<td>	delete to end of line
	</table></dl>
	</ul>
	Shift-select mode (<code class=option>-kS</code>) 
	may become the default in a future version.
	<p>
	Visual selection is toggled by the following actions:
	<ul>
	<li>Start visual selection highlighting:
		<ul>
		<li>mouse click (then drag)
		<li>Mark command (Home key, Control-space, or Mark/Select from quick menu or Edit menu)
		<li>(in Shift-select mode) Shift-cursor keys
		</ul>
	<li>Extend visual selection highlighting:
		<ul>
		<li>mouse drag
		<li>keyboard navigation
		<li>(in Shift-select mode) Shift-cursor keys
		<li>mouse click
		<li>(in Shift-select mode) Shift-mouse-click
		</ul>
	<li>Hide visual selection highlighting:
		<ul>
		<li>modify text
		<li>(unless in Windows keypad mode) Copy (End key or from quick menu or Edit menu)
		<li>Mark twice (e.g. press Home Home)
		<li>(unless in Windows keypad mode) mouse release (after drag, with auto-copy option)
		<li>Find (except Find matching parenthesis) (except with "keep on search" option)
		<li>Goto text position
		<li>Open file
		</ul>
	<li>Re-enable selection highlighting and continue previous selection:
		<ul>
		<li>"continue Select" from menu
		<li>(in Shift-select mode) Shift-cursor keys
		<li>(in Shift-select mode) Shift-mouse-click
		</ul>
	</ul>
	Selection behaviour can be tuned with a few options in the 
	Paste buffer menu.
	<p><i>Note:</i> The actual behaviour of the paste buffer functions 
	acting on the text selection (Copy, Cut) are not affected by the 
	visual selection; they work alike even if the selection is hidden.
	<br>The <span class=ex>Delete</span> key is the only function 
	that is actually modified by visual selection, following a 
	dual-mode behaviour consistent with most contemporary text editors:
	if a non-empty visual selection is active, it deletes the 
	selected area (Cut to paste buffer),
	otherwise, it deletes the next character.

<a name=rectangular></a>
<h3>	<img align=right src=rectangular.png>
	Rectangular copy/paste</h3>
	Rectangular copy/paste area mode can be toggled on the 
	Paste buffer flag (see also description of 
	<a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a>), 
	in the Paste buffer menu, with HOP Mark while already on marked position, 
	or preselected with the option <code class=option>+[</code>.
	<br>Rectangular selection can also be toggled temporarily by using 
	Alt with the left mouse button while moving the mouse for 
	drag-selection.
	Note, however, that a subsequent paste will apply the untoggled mode.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Rectangular area is a property of the 
	copy/paste function, not of the paste buffer.
	<br><i>Note:</i> The result of rectangular paste may not be 
	quite as expected in these cases:
	<ul>
	<li>The paste buffer contains lines of different length.
	<li>The border of the paste area (in either the text or the 
	paste buffer) contains characters of different width, like 
	TAB, double-width, or isolated combining characters, or even 
	incomplete character codes.
	</ul>

<h3>	Text position markers</h3>
	A default marker for quick use and additional 
	16 numbered text markers are available. 
	<br>
	Marker 0 has a special function: 1. it is set when opening a 
	file at the memorized position, 2. whenever a new current 
	marker is set, the previous one is pushed to marker 0.
	<br>
	For keyboard commands to set and move to markers, 
	see <a href=#markernavigation>Text marker navigation</a>
	in the Command reference below.

<a name=markerstack></a>
<h3>	Text position marker stack</h3>
	In addition to the explicit text markers, 
	mined implicitly maintains a marker stack to support navigation 
	and orientation when browsing files.
	Whenever a command moves the position by a far distance 
	(Go to marker, Go to line, Go to file beginning/end, 
	Go to next/previous file, Search functions including Search 
	identifier definition across files, Replace with confirm), the 
	current position is first pushed to this stack.
	Later, in order to return to the previous position, use 
	the command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) to move along the positions 
	in the marker stack.
	The command HOP ESC Enter (HOP Alt-Enter) moves again forward 
	along the stack.

<a name=justification></a>
<h3>	Paragraph justification / word wrap</h3>
	Manual paragraph line/word wrap is invoked with the 
	justify command (ESC j or ESC J); it justifies the current 
	paragraph (wraps its lines/words) according to the effective 
	margins and paragraph termination mode.
	<br><i>Clever justification:</i> With ESC j, mined automatically 
	determines left margins depending on the current paragraph and 
	line contents. Heuristic detection of numbered items will trigger 
	automatic indentation.
	<br><i>Normal justification:</i> With ESC J, mined justifies 
	strictly according to the margin values currently configured.
	<br>See commands listing below "<a href=#escj>ESC j</a>" 
	for margin setting commands.

<p>
	<i>Paragraph termination modes:</i>
	Two different definitions of paragraph end are available.
	<ul>
	<li>The primary mode is to add a space at the end of each line 
	    when the paragraph continues and to end the line without 
	    space where the paragraph ends. This seems an intuitive 
	    way and as a big advantage over other approaches, it is 
	    transparent with respect to visual formatting, i.e. no 
	    text property is required that would affect visual layout 
	    of the text.
	    <br><i>Note:</i> Additional visual support of paragraph end 
	    detection is available with the mined option <code class=option>-p</code> that 
	    distinguishes paragraph/line end display.
	<li>The other word-wrap mode is to add an empty (blank-only) 
	    line after each paragraph. Obviously this imposes more 
	    additional requirements on text formatting discipline and 
	    reduces freedom of text layout.
	</ul>
	The mode in effect is indicated in the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags display; 
	see description of <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a>.

<a name=autoindent></a>
<h3>	Auto indentation</h3>
	By default, mined acts in auto-indent mode: When you enter a 
	newline, the following line will be filled with the same 
	prefix of space characters (Space or Tab) as the current one.
	This option can be toggled from the Options menu.
	A new line without auto indentation can be entered 
	with the ^O command.
<p>	Auto indentation is automatically suppressed if text is entered 
	very fast (by heuristic detection of input speed) in order to 
	allow unmodified copy and paste using terminal mouse functions.

<a name=listsupport></a>
<h3>	Advanced list support (bullet and numbered lists)</h3>
	A new paragraph (according to the currently selected 
	paragraph end mode, or considering Unicode paragraph separators) 
	after a bullet or numbered item will clone the bullet or 
	auto-increment the numbering.
	The undent function (smart Backspace) considers list bullets 
	or numberings, removing the last level.
	<br><i>Note:</i> An item paragraph is considered to start at 
	a bullet or numbering even if the previous line does not 
	terminate a paragraph.

<h4>Structure input commands</h4>
	A pair of parentheses with matched indentation can be entered 
	by prefixing a parenthesis character with HOP.
	For example, HOP "{" would enter a pair of "{" "}", both 
	auto-indented on their respective new line. Other pairs are 
	"(" ")", "[" "]", "&lt" ">".
<br>	HOP "/" enters an indented Javadoc comment frame.

<h4>Back-Tab (Undent function / reverse indent)</h4>
	<i>Smart backspacing:</i> A Backarrow key from a position that is 
	only preceded by white space on the line and on the line above 
	will revert the input position to the previous matching 
	indentation level.
	To avoid auto-undentation ("Delete single"), use 
	Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow to delete only one character left, 
	or toggle auto-indentation off from the Options menu.
	<br><i>Note:</i> In xterm, Ctrl-Backarrow only works if configured 
	in your X configuration, see the example configuration file 
	<code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<br><i>Note:</i>Configuration option <code class=option>plain_BS</code> 
	(command line option <code class=option>+Bp</code>) switches 
	the Backarrow key from smart backspacing to plain backspacing, 
	i.e. no auto-undent and only delete one combining character of 
	a combined character.
	Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing then.

<h4>Tab expansion</h4>
	With one of the options <code class=option>-+8</code>, 
	<code class=option>-+4</code>, <code class=option>-+2</code>, 
	a Tab key input will be expanded to an appropriate number of 
	Space characters instead of inserting a Tab character. You can 
	still insert a literal Tab character with Ctrl-V Tab.

<a name=searchmultilines></a>
<h3>	Search and replace multiple lines</h3>
	Mined has overcome the typical Unix tool limitation of line 
	orientation in search operations.
	Search and replacement patterns can contain embedded newlines. 
	Enter a newline (linefeed character) in the search string with 
	^V^J or \n (or \r to match CRLF newlines).
	<br><i>Note:</i> If combining multi-line substitution with 
	substitution references (&, \1, etc), lineend types are not 
	strictly preserved.

<a name=substitution></a>
<h3>	<img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2022.26>Substitution references</h3>
	Mined supports 10 substitution references (like <code>sed</code>), 
	a full match reference "<code class=ex>&</code>" and 
	<img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2022.26>
	numbered references "<code class=ex>\1</code>" through 
	"<code class=ex>\9</code>" to refer to the corresponding 
	matching sub-expressions marked "<code class=ex>\(...\)</code>" 
	in the search pattern. Sub-expressions can be nested.

<a name=underline></a>
<h3>	Header line underlining</h3>
	The command HOP "-" (e.g. Ctrl-G -) underlines the 
	header line before the cursor position with as many "-" 
	characters as needed; it applies to the current line unless 
	the cursor is at a line beginning in which case it applies to 
	the previous line.

<a name=backspaceadaptation></a>
<h3>	Automatic backspace mode adaptation</h3>
	There is much confusion about what character codes are delivered 
	by the Backarrow and Del keyboard keys in different 
	operating environments and configurations.
	For proper operation, the "stty erase CHAR" configuration should 
	generally be set correctly to reflect the actual code emitted 
	by the terminal.
	Mined detects this setting and adjusts its handling accordingly, 
	so that the "Backarrow" key should normally work as expected 
	(delete a character left).

<h2>Overview: input support features</h2>
<dl><dd>

<h3>	Character input</h3>
	Mined provides several methods to support input of special 
	characters that may not be easily available on the keyboard.
	<ul>
	<li><a href=#composedinput>Accented and mnemonic input support</a>
	defines <a href=#accentprefixkeys>Accent prefix keys</a> 
	to compose accent combinations with subsequently entered characters.

<span id=handlingfiles onMouseOver="chapter (this);">
<h2>Handling files with mined</h2>
<dl><dd>

<a name=tags></a>
<h3>	Tags file support / Identifier and file lookup</h3>
	The ESC t command moves to the definition of an identifier 
	(on which the cursor should be placed) using the tags file 
	(generated by the <code>ctags</code> command). 
	HOP ESC t prompts for an identifier. (Also available from 
	search or popup menu.)
	If a new file is opened for this purpose, the current 
	file is saved automatically.
	<br>As a special function, if ESC t is typed on an include statement 
	(line beginning with "#include" or "include"), 
	the included file will be opened.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Like with a number of positioning commands, 
	ESC t places the current position on the position marker stack 
	before going to the location of the identifier definition. The 
	command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) moves back to that position, 
	also saving the current file if needed first.

<a name=encrypted></a>
<h3>	Encrypted files</h3>
	Mined edits encrypted files transparently.
	<br>
	For reading or writing an encrypted file, a respective filter is 
	used as configured in the runtime configuration file 
	<code class=path>$HOME/.minedrc</code>. See the sample configuration 
	file in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	for details. It contains pre-configured entries for using 
	GnuPG (for files ending with "<code class=path>.gpg</code>" or 
	"<code class=path>.pgp</code>") or openssl (for files ending with 
	"<code class=path>.ssl</code>").
	<br>Mined does not currently provide handling for passwords or 
	passphrases for file encryption. Therefore, any passwords or 
	passphrases needed for encrypted file access will either have to be 
	entered on every access, or password or passphrase files may be 
	used as offered by the respective decryption and encryption commands 
	of GnuPG and openssl. See the sample configuration file for examples.
	<br><i>Note:</i> If manual password input is used with openssl, 
	be careful to remember the password which is newly assigned every 
	time the file is written.
	<br><i>Note:</i> When editing an encrypted file, the backup file 
	will be encrypted, too. Decrypted content is exchanged with the 
	filters using pipes, so no intermediate decrypted version is stored 
	on the file system. Copy/paste text blocks are not encrypted, though, 
	but they are readable for the current user only anyway (on any 
	nontrivial file system). The same applies for a recovery file 
	that mined writes in emergency cases to save the edited text.

<a name=datasecurity></a>
<h3>	Data safety and security</h3>
	Mined has a robust and defensive concept of handling edited 
	text and file contents in case of any kind of program or 
	system errors.
<a name=backup></a>
<h4>Backup files</h4>
	With command line option(s) <code class=option>+b</code>, 
	mined saves a backup copy of any file being overwritten 
	(like saving the file being edited, saving to a different file, 
	copying the paste buffer to a file).
	It supports three backup file name conventions and a few 
	combined modes to select among them:
	<dl><dd><table border=0>
	<tr valign=top><td width=30><code class=option>+b-</code>
		<td>no backup files
	<tr valign=top><td xwidth=30><code class=option>+bs</code>
		<td>simple backup files: <code class=reverse><i>filename</i>~</code>
	<tr valign=top><td xwidth=30><code class=option>+be</code>
		<td>emacs style numbered backup files: <code class=reverse><i>filename</i>.~N~</code>

	<dd><i>Note:</i> To place backup files in a different directory 
	than the original file, use the environment variable 
	<span class=env>BACKUP_DIRECTORY</span> or <span class=env>BACKUPDIR</span>.
	It can be either an absolute pathname (e.g. 
	<code class=path>$HOME/.backups</code>) or a relative pathname 
	(e.g. <code class=path>.~</code>) in which case backup files 
	are stored relative to the respective working directory of 
	mined.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> On VMS, backup options are ignored as VMS handles 
	backup files natively.
<h4>File locking</h4>
	Mined checks and maintains interoperable lock files, which are 
	symbolic links mentioning the user and machine currently 
	editing the file (not on MSDOS and VMS).
	If the user tries to modify the text of a file locked by somebody 
	else, mined informs the user and changes editing mode to view-only.
	The lock can be overridden (removed or ignored) from the File menu.
	<br>
	Mined implements workarounds for network file systems that do 
	not support handling lock files or symbolic links properly: 
	cygwin symbolic links that appear as plain text files on 
	Samba/CIFS mounted file shares,
	and lock files that could be created but cannot be deleted due 
	to weird permission configuration of a network file share.
<h4>Edited text / Recovery files</h4>
	Every care has been taken to prevent loss of the edited text 
	in case of save errors or accidental quit commands etc; mined 
	always prompts before discarding any modified text, even when 
	editing without an associated filename (in which case other 
	popular editors ignore loss of edited text).
	<br>
	There are three cases, however, in which edited text would be lost:
	<ul>
	<li>if the user explicitly discards edited text (e.g. ESQ q and 
	not answering the "Save?" question with "y")
	<li>if mined is sent an external terminating signal
	(e.g. on terminal I/O error); two exceptions are the SIGKILL signal 
	(which cannot be caught by a program) and SIGTERM (see below)
	<li>in the rare case that mined should fail with an internal signal
	(e.g. if out of memory)
	</ul>
	In these cases, mined can save the edited text in a recovery file 
	<code class=path>dir/#name#</code> (when editing file 
	<code class=path>dir/name</code>); in the explicit case, this 
	is only done if the answer to the "Save?" question is "r" 
	(to "recover later").
	If the edited file is later opened, and a recovery file still 
	exists (which is newer than the file being opened), mined will 
	display a notice. In the File menu, there is the option to 
	recover the text from the recovery file.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> The recovery file is interoperable with emacs 
	(as are the use cases); however, mined is superior here 
	because emacs mangles non-ASCII characters in recovery files.
	Mind, though, that interoperability with respect to recognising 
	recovery files depends on consistent configuration of their 
	location; see the directory configuration option below.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> If mined is sent an explicit SIGTERM signal 
	it tries to terminate normally instead, writing modified text 
	to the file being edited, including interactive handling if needed.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> After catching a signal, mined also tries an 
	emergency save of the edited text into a "panic file" 
	in one of the directories <span class=env>$TMPDIR</span>, 
	<span class=env>$TMP</span>, <span class=env>$TEMP</span>, 
	<code class=path>/usr/tmp</code>, or <code class=path>/tmp</code> 
	(whichever variable is defined first and directory is writable 
	in this order; or similar directories under VMS or MSDOS).
	The file contains the edited text, identical to the recovery file.
	It is written first, before the recovery file, to provide a quick 
	save attempt e.g. if the system is crashing and the file system 
	of the edited file is no longer available.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> If possible, mined also tries to continue 
	normally after panic handling (unless multiple external signals 
	are nested).
	<dd><i>Note:</i> To place recovery files in a different directory 
	than the original file, use the environment variable 
	<span class=env>AUTO_SAVE_DIRECTORY</span> or <span class=env>AUTOSAVEDIR</span> 
	or <span class=env>BACKUP_DIRECTORY</span> or <span class=env>BACKUPDIR</span> 
	as described for <href=#backup>backup files</s> above.
<h4>Overwriting files and Change monitoring</h4>
	If any command is issued to write to a file not previously 
	read in (after change of file name or working directory, or 
	with a Copy to file command), mined prompts for confirmation.
	<br>Also, if mined detects that the file being edited has been changed, 
	it displays a notice and asks for confirmation before saving.
	To this aim, mined checks the modification time, file size, 
	device and inode (in case the file got replaced by 
	rename/move/mount operations).
	This is checked if mined is notified of refocussing the window 
	(if supported by the terminal), and after shell commands 
	(ESC !, ESC c, ESC z).

<h4>File access permissions</h4>
	When creating a new file, its access permissions are set 
	according to the default behaviour set in the user 
	environment (umask setting in Unix).
	However, when cloning a file (with Save As / Set Name / ESC n 
	/ ESC d), file access permissions of the originally opened file 
	are preserved and cloned.
	<br>The <code class=option>+x</code> command line option adds 
	executable permission to newly created files
	but only to those users that are also given read permission 
	by the rules above.

<h3>	Special file types</h3>
<h4>Character or block device files</h4>
	Mined rejects reading from or writing to a device file in order 
	to prevent being blocked.
	Exception: <code class=path>/dev/clipboard</code> on cygwin.
<h4>FIFO files</h4>
	Mined can edit a FIFO file (named pipe) like any other file.
	Before mined can finish loading from the pipe, another process 
	needs to have written to it and then close it.
	Before mined can finish saving to the pipe, another process 
	needs to have opened it for reading.
<h4>Pipe input</h4>
	When invoked within a pipe, redirecting input, mined loads its 
	text buffer from standard input.
	Mined does not manipulate the screen mode before data is available 
	from the pipe, so to some extent it can interwork even with 
	screen programs providing its input.
<h4>Pipe output</h4>
	In the "Editing for standard output" mode (i.e. when invoked 
	within a pipe, redirecting output), only one "file save" 
	operation can be performed writing to standard output.
	If more than one such operations are issued (e.g. using the 
	ESC w / F2 , F3, or suspend command) only the first one 
	will write the text buffer to standard output; any subsequent 
	one is treated as usual (with empty file name).
	If mined exits after writing to a pipe, it does not manipulate 
	the screen mode after beginning to write, so to some extent it 
	can interwork even with screen programs taking its output.

<a name=binarytransparency></a>
<h3>	Line end modes and binary-transparent editing</h3>
	Mined is binary transparent. It can handle all types of 
	line ends (Unix (LF), DOS (CRLF), Mac (CR, with option 
	<code class=option>+R</code>), 
	ISO 8859/EBCDIC Next Line (NL, not after auto-detection of 
	text encoding), and Unicode separators (LS, PS)) 
	simultaneously in the same editing session. They are indicated 
	by different visible line end indications. Files without 
	trailing line end can be edited and created (using the delete 
	character right function on the last line end). NUL characters 
	are handled as virtual line ends. Lines too long for internal 
	handling are split transparently (with a "none" virtual 
	line end).
<br>	Character codes that are illegal in the currently selected 
	text encoding are maintained transparently and are clearly 
	indicated (e.g. illegal UTF-8 sequences in Unicode text).
<br>	Files with mixed encoding (e.g. UTF-8 / 8 bit sections) can 
	be edited comfortably.
<br>	<i>Input:</i> To enter a NUL character, use ^V # 0 or 
	^V NUL or ^V Ctrl-Space (if the keyboard supports Ctrl-Space).

<a name=memory></a>
<h3>	File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters</h3>
	On every file saving command, mined remembers the last text position, 
	paragraph justification margins (only if automatic paragraph 
	justification is active), selected Smart Quotes style and 
	Input Method (Keyboard Mapping), and TAB display width.
	File info memory is relative to the working directory, 
	using a hidden file info file (<code class=path>.@mined</code> -
	mined also handles its DOS short name <code class=path>@MINED~1</code> 
	where it occurs, to provide some interoperability with the DOS 
	version of mined); previously used file marker files 
	(<code class=path>@mined.mar</code>) will be migrated and 
	cleared from duplicate entries.
<p>	<i>Note:</i> File information is stored every time the user 
	invokes a command to save the file (even if no write is 
	performed because the text has not been edited).
	When editing that file again (from the same working 
	directory), mined will automatically move to that position 
	(and set text marker 0 to it).

<h4>File info grooming</h4>
	Mined checks and removes duplicate entries (from previous versions) 
	in the file info file.
	With option <code class=option>+@</code>, mined also 
	checks whether file info entries correspond to actual files 
	that exist and are visible to the user; 
	it will otherwise remove such entries.
	Mined can be called with this option alone and will then exit after 
	file info grooming. Mind, however, that files may be invisible 
	only temporarily (e.g. due to unmounted file systems, or unplugged 
	USB drives), and will get their info entries removed then, too.

<a name=filechooser></a>
<h3>	<img align=right src=file-chooser.png>
	File chooser</h3>
	To select a filename for a file operation (e.g. open, save, insert, 
	write buffer), mined opens an interactive file chooser that presents 
	a listing of files and directories in the current directory 
	(for the change directory command, only directories are shown).
	The list can be navigated and manipulated in these ways:
	<ul>
	<li>cursor keys (including page down/up, end/begin)
	<li>mouse movement and scroll
	<li>entering a filename prefix which navigates to the first file 
	matching it
	<li>TAB will usually copy the current filename into the editing 
	field (if it was partially matching a file name, it is thus 
	completed, similar to file completion on the command line but 
	case-insensitively)
	<li>TAB on a directory will navigate the file chooser into it
	<li>TAB or HOP while the filename editing field is containing 
	wildcards interprets the entered file name as a pattern and 
	switches to a filtered file listing (recognising
	"<code class=ex>*</code>", "<code class=ex>?</code>", 
	"<code class=ex>[abc-x]</code>", "<code class=ex>[^abc-x]</code>" 
	wildcard expressions, no escapes)
	<li>Enter on a directory will navigate the file chooser into it 
	(unless for the ESC d command in which case it is selected)
	<li>Enter on a selected (or entered) filename will choose the name
	</ul>
	Also, a filename can be typed in directly (being interpreted as 
	a filename prefix interactively). The filename or prefix is 
	displayed in the title bar of the popup file chooser menu.
	When entering file or directory names, the leading ~ notation 
	to refer to one's home directory is accepted.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> The full path name of the currently displayed 
	directory is shown as the first entry in the file chooser menu.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> A few sorting options are offered in the 
	"Options" - "File sort options..." submenu.
	They can also be preselected with the command line option 
	<code class=option>+z</code>X. See the 
	<a href=#filechooseroption>file chooser options</a> for details.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> In the file chooser, filenames are interpreted 
	in Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) while file name parameters given on the 
	command line are interpreted in the terminal encoding. This may 
	lead to inconsistent handling of non-ASCII filenames. Use the 
	ESC ? command to display the file name using native encoding.
	<dd><i>Note:</i> On some file systems, retrieving directory 
	information can be slow.
	Mined handles this and provides feedback about delayed operation, 
	retrieves directory information lazy by page being displayed, 
	and flushes display of the file chooser by line to provide 
	visual feedback about the file information being retrieved.

<a name=filetabs></a>
<h3>	<img align=right src=file-tabs.png>
	File tabs</h3>
	Mined provides virtual file tabs above the header line, listing 
	file names as opened via command line or file chooser. By clicking 
	a file name in the file tabs panel, or hold-and-move the mouse 
	over them, you can change the file being edited. If the current 
	file has been modified it will be saved first.
	<br>Right-clicking opens the file switcher menu (like Alt-F3),
	control-right click opens the file opening menu (like F3),
	control-mouse wheel scroll switches to the next/previous file tab.

<a name=fileswitcher></a>
<h3>	<img align=right src=file-switcher.png>
	File switcher</h3>
	The File switcher presents a list of active files to select from, 
	comprising files supplied on the command line, and files 
	opened or saved later.
	Invoke the File switcher with Alt-# or ESC #, or Alt-F3 or ESC F3, 
	or from the File menu. The Close file command (from the File menu) 
	closes the current file and removes its name from the list.
	The list can be navigated and manipulated in these ways:
	<ul>
	<li>cursor keys (including page down/up, end/begin)
	<li>mouse movement and scroll
	<li>entering a filename prefix which navigates to the first file 
	matching it
	<li>Enter on a selected (or entered) filename will choose the name
	</ul>
	To reload the current file and stay (approximately) at the 
	current position, use ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) after reloading.

<h3>	Page length</h3>
	The command ESC P sets the number of lines that mined assumes 
	to be on a page. So the status line can contain the page 
	number to make finding the current position in a print-out 
	easy. Also the Goto Line/% command (^G etc.) accepts a final 
	'p' or 'P' in which cases it positions to the top of the given 
	page.
	This information will be associated and stored with the file 
	name if file position memory is enabled; see 
	<a href=#memory>File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters</a>
	above.

<h3>	Restricted mode (tool mode)</h3>
	Restricted mode is triggered with
<pre>
		<code class=option>mined --</code> [ filenames ... ]
</pre>
	or (if installed)
<pre>
		<code class=option>rmined</code> [ filenames ... ]
</pre>
	In restricted mode, only the file opened when mined was started can 
	be edited, no commands changing file name reference, involving other 
	files (copy/paste), or escaping to a shell command will be allowed.

<a name=backup></a>
<h3>	Backup integration</h3>
	From the File menu, a backup command is available that invokes a 
	"bu" script (which must reside in the user's command search path).

<a name=versioncontrol></a>
<h3>	Version control integration</h3>
	From the File menu, checkout and checkin commands are 
	available that invoke "co" or "ci" scripts, respectively 
	(which must reside in the user's command search path).
	This offers a gateway to ClearCase or other version control 
	systems; mined applies automatic save or screen update 
	as appropriate.

<a name=printing></a>
<h3>	Printing</h3>
	From the File menu, a print command is available that 
	prints the text currently being edited.
	If the script <code>uprint</code> is installed and configured 
	properly, printing works in any selected character encoding.
	See <a href=#printconf>Printing configuration</a> for further 
	details.
	<p>In Windows, mined uses <code>notepad /p</code> for printing.
	<br><i>Note:</i> The font size interactively configured in 
	<code>notepad</code> also affects the print size; with a 
	fixed-width font, a font size of not more than 10pt gives you 
	at least 80 characters per line; if 72 characters per line are 
	enough, you can use 11pt font size.

<h3>	Scrollbar</h3>
	By default, mined displays a scrollbar at the right side. It 
	may be used for position indication within the text and for 
	relative or absolute positioning with the three mouse buttons.
	<br>In a UTF-8 terminal, mined uses Unicode character cell 
	vertical eighths characters U+2581..U+2587 for a fine-grained 
	scrollbar display. If your Unicode font doesn't include those 
	block characters, you may switch to the cell-grained scrollbar 
	with the <code class=option>-o1</code> option.

<h3>	Text position marker stack</h3>
	On commands that jump away from the current position (HOP Mark, 
	File Begin/End, Search, Search identifier definition, Search 
	current character, Goto Line/%, Goto Next/Previous File), 
	the current position is remembered in a position stack. 
	The command ESC Enter goes backward, HOP ESC Enter forward 
	in this "stack", even if this means switching the file 
	being edited.

<a name=structed></a>
<h3>	Structured editing support</h3>

<a name=html></a>
<h4>HTML support: syntax highlighting and tag entry/matching</h4>
	<i>HTML tag entry:</i> With the <a href=#escH>ESC H commands</a>,
	opening and closing HTML tags can be entered or (with HOP) a 
	marked area can be enclosed into HTML tags.
	<br><i>Syntax highlighting:</i> HTML tags and comments, 
	attributes and values can be highlighted, or dimmed to set 
	them back from the actual text contents; if mined detects a 
	dark terminal background (works with xterm and mintty), it 
	adds a highlighting background to improve the contrast.
	Other highlighting modes apply to HTML comments and JSP code.
	This option is activated if the file name suffix is
	one of .html, .htm, .xhtml, .shtml, .mhtml, .sgml, 
	.xml, .eml, .xul, .xsd, .xsl, .xslt, .wsdl, .dtd;
	it can be toggled from the Options menu.
	Additional highlighting of embedded server-side scripting is 
	activated if the file name suffix is one of
	.jsp, .php, .asp, .aspx.
	<br>HTML/XML syntax highlighting can be enabled with option 
	<code class=option>+H</code> or using 
	<a href=#preferences>Preference configuration</a> per file-type.
	<br><i>HTML tag matching:</i> With the ESC ( or ESC ) command, 
	mined searches for the opening / closing HTML tag 
	corresponding to the current one.
	<br><i>Note:</i> While you edit within a line and change its HTML 
	ending status (by entering or deleting '&lt' or '>'), the 
	display status of subsequent lines is not changed. (You may 
	refresh the display with ESC ".")
	<br><i>Configuration hint:</i> The colour used for displaying HTML 
	tags can be configured with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDHTML</span> 
	using an ANSI sequence, e.g. <span class=env>MINEDHTML</span>=34 (the default).

<h4>Search structure match</h4>
	With the ESC ( or ESC ) commands, mined searches for a matching 
	end of various structures, like opening/closing HTML/XML tags 
	(see above), matching parentheses or brackets, matching 
	comments (/* */), matching conditional macros (#if...), 
	mail messages (in a mailbox file), MIME attachments.
	See the <a name=match>ESC ( command</a> in the command 
	reference for details.

<h4>Structure input</h4>
	A structure template with opening and closing ends can be 
	inserted with the structured input feature. HOP followed by 
	one of { , ( , [ , &lt; enters a corresponding bracket pair, 
	HOP / enters a Javadoc comment frame. HOP &ndash; enters an 
	underlining line matching the previous line.
	<p>Visual structure input is supported by 
	<a href=#autoindent>Auto indentation</a>

<a name=password></a>
<h3>	Password hiding</h3>
	With the option <code class=option>-P</code>, mined hides 
	one word (separated by white space) behind the string 
	"assword" in a line (to accommodate for "password" or 
	"Password") and displays reverse "*" instead.
	Password hiding can be disabled with <code class=option>+P</code>.
	<br>By default (without any <code class=option>P</code> option), 
	password hiding is activated when editing a file whose 
	file name starts with "." (Unix "hidden" file convention).

<h3>	Virtual bold/underline stropping</h3>
	With the option <code class=option>+ZZ</code>, mined displays 
	all-capital words in bold lower-case and supports their input 
	using only a first capital letter, then small letters to input 
	a word in all-upper-case.
	This is to support editing computer programs in Algol-like 
	languages in their typical publication look.
	Use <code class=option>+Z_</code> for underline stropping,
	disable with <code class=option>-ZZ</code>. Enabled by default 
	if the filename ends with "<code class=path>.a68</code>".

<h3>	Long line splitting</h3>
	Mined has an internal line length limit (> ca. 1024 characters).
	When opening a file, longer lines are split. This is handled 
	transparently as virtual "none" line ends are used and indicated.
	When saving the file, lines will be joined again.

<a name=visible></a>
<h3>	Visible indication of line contents and display</h3>
	Various options are available to indicate line control characters 
	(Tab and line-feed) as well as shifted line display (of lines 
	longer than the screen width). 
	(So you can see how many dummy blank spaces there are before the 
	line ends or how many superfluous blank spaces precede a Tab 
	character.)
<br>	Environment variables can be used to modify these indications. 
	See <a href=#layout>Display layout</a> for details.
<br>	Default indications and according configuration variables:
	<dl><dd><table name=lineindications border=0>
	<tr valign=top><td width=50><code class=linedisp>«</code>

		(may contain up to 3 characters to configure different 
		appearance within the Tab span)
	</table></dl>
	<p><i>Configuration:</i> Display colour of the indications is 
	by default red or a dimmed foreground colour; this can be changed 
	with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDDIM</span>, 
	display colour for Unicode line end indications and other 
	special (esp. invalid) character indications with <span 
	class=env>MINEDSPECIAL</span>. Their values should be the 
	numeric part of an ANSI terminal control sequence, e.g. 31 for 
	red, "33;44" for yellow text on blue background.
	<span class=env>MINEDDIM</span> can also be set to an integer 
	percentage value (e.g. <span class=env>MINEDIM</span>="50%") 
	to have mined apply dim colour to the indications; the colour 
	value is computed from the current foreground and background 
	colours (if the terminal supports their detection).
	<br>For more details and recommended settings see the example 
	script file <code class=path>profile.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	Default values are compiled in and can be overridden by setting 
	the variables to empty values.
	<p><i>Note:</i> With the <code class=option>-F</code> option, 
	mined limits usage of special characters for line indication 
	and suppresses the interpretation of the <span class=env>MINEDUTF</span>* environment 
	variables.

<h3>	Function key help bars</h3>
	For quick reference of functions attached to function keys, 
	modified function keys, and other modified keys (as used for 
	accent prefix functions), a number of help bars can be 
	displayed in the bottom line.
	<br>F1 followed by another F1, optionally modified by a combination 
	of Control/Shift/Alt, displays a help line with function 
	attachments to the respectively modified function keys; F1 followed 
	by Ctrl-1/Alt-1/Alt-Ctrl-1 or Control with a punctuation key 
	(e.g. Ctrl-,) displays a help line for the respective accent 
	prefix functions attached.
	See the <a href=#F1bars>F1 help bars command reference</a> for details.

<a name=menudisp></a>
<h3>	Menu display</h3>
	Menu borders are displayed using Unicode Box Drawing characters 
	in a UTF-8 terminal, using VT100-mode graphics characters if 
	they are detected to be available, or using ASCII graphics otherwise.
	<br><i>Configuration hint:</i> The menu style option 
	<code class=option>-Q</code> is available to configure your 
	style preference; see also <a href=#terminalinterworking>
	Terminal interworking problems</a> for configuration hints 
	to deal terminal-related graphics display trouble.
	Alternatively, the option <code class=option>-f</code> reduces 
	font assumptions and adjusts usage of special characters accordingly.
	<br>In addition to round or rectangular corners, also fancy 
	item selection display style can be selected 
	(<code class=option>-Q</code>).
	<br>With a non-UTF-8 terminal, if your system's 
	termcap/terminfo database does not indicate the VT100 graphics 
	capability for the terminal you use but you know (or want to 
	try if) your terminal has that capability, use of graphical 
	borders can be enforced with the <code class=option>-Qv</code> 
	command line option.
	<br><i>Configuration hint:</i> The colour of menu borders can be 
	changed with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDBORDER</span>.
	The marker of selected items in flag menus can be changed with 
	the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDMENUMARKER</span>.
	<br>The apperance of the menu background and borders can be configured 
	in the runtime configuration file <code class=path>$HOME/.minedrc</code>.

<h2>Language support</h2>
<dl><dd>
	Most of the information in this chapter is redundant. It 
	collects language-specific features described in the other 
	chapters in a more technical context, here assorted by 
	languages / scripts for more convenient quick reference.
	<br>Language-specific typographic quotation marks are 
	supported by the <a href=#smartquotes>Smart quotes</a> feature.

<!p><hr class=sep width=95%>
<h3>	Latin-script languages</h3>
<h4>Character sets</h4>
	In addition to Unicode, mined supports Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1), 
	Latin-9 (ISO 8859-15), 
	Mac-Roman, Windows (CP1252) and DOS (CP437, CP850) Western 
	character sets, as well as further ISO character sets for 
	Central European (Latin-2, ISO 8859-2), South European 
	(Latin-3, ISO 8859-3), Turkish (Latin-5, ISO 8859-9), 
	Nordic (Latin-6, ISO 8859-10), Baltic (Latin-7, ISO 8859-13), 
	Celtic (Latin-8, ISO 8859-14), Romanian (Latin-10, ISO 8859-16), 
	EBCDIC (CP1047), 
	<img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2022.26>
	and ISO 6937.
	To view and edit a file in one of these encodings, select it 
	from the Encoding menu (section "8 Bit" for Western, or 
	submenu "more Latin"), or use the respective command line parameter.
	See <a href=#encodingflags>Character encoding</a> flags for details.
	<br><i>Terminal:</i> If your terminal runs any of these encodings, 
	mined can detect this by proper setting of environment variables 
	(<span class=env>LC_</span>* or <span class=env>LANG</span>, and <span class=env>TERM</span>).
	See <a href=#terminalenv>Terminal environment</a> for details.
<h4>Character input support</h4>
	<dl>
	For input of accented characters, mined provides an extensive 
	set of accent prefix functions, covering Western accents as well as
	<ul>
	<li>Macron (Latvian, Lithuanian, Polynesian languages)
	<li>Breve (Romanian, Turkish)
	<li>Dot above (Lithuanian, Polish)
	<li>Ogonek (Lithuanian, Polish)
	<li>Caron/Há&#269;ek (Croatian, Czech, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Slovenian, Slovak)
	<li>Stroke (Croatian, Maltese, Polish, Vietnamese)
	<li>and others
	</ul>
	</dl>
	For other characters and ligatures, mined provides mnemonic input.
	<br>See <a href=#characterinputsupport>Character input support</a> 
	for more details.
<h4>Language-specific mnemonic conversion support</h4>
	<dl>
	The generic mnemonic transformation command ESC _ (which 
	transforms a mnemonic transcription in the text into its 
	accented or ligature character) has a few national variants, 
	using keys available on the respective keyboards as commands:
	<ul>
	<li><b>German:</b> ESC ö etc. transforms ae to ä, oe to ö
	<li><b>French:</b> ESC é etc. transforms ae to æ, oe to oe ligature
	<li><b>Scandinavian:</b> ESC å etc. transforms ae to æ, oe to ø
	<li><b>Italian:</b> ESC ì etc. transforms 'e or ´e to è rather than é etc.
	<li><b>East European></b> ESC &lt accented letter typical on East European 
	keyboard > (like l with stroke, u with ring, o with double acute, 
	s with caron, etc)
	transforms ,e to e with ogonek (rather than cedilla) etc., 
	and -d to d with stroke
	</ul>
	(See <a href=#mnemonictrans>mnemonic character substitution 
	commands</a> in the Command reference for details.)
	</dl>
<h4>Language-specific case conversion</h4>
	<i>(The following rules apply if the respective language is 
	indicated by the language tag as extracted from one of the 
	environment variables 
	<span class=env>LANGUAGE</span>, 
	<span class=env>TEXTLANG</span>, <span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, 
	<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, <span class=env>LANG</span>.)</i>
	<p><b>Lithuanian:</b>
	(If language tag begins with "lt")
	Proper case conversion of accented i with retained i dot.
	<p><b>Turkish, Azeri, Tatar, Bashkir:</b>
	(If language tag begins with "tr" or "az" or "crh" or "tt" or "ba")
	Proper case conversion of i<->I with dot above / dotless i<->I.
	<p><b>Dutch:</b>
	(If language tag begins with "nl")
	Title case conversion with Shift-F3 supports "IJ" pseudo ligature 
	like in "IJsselmeer".

<!p><hr class=sep width=95%>
<h3>	Esperanto</h3>
<h4>Character sets</h4>
	In addition to Unicode, mined supports the Latin-3 character set 
	(ISO 8859-3), and the DOS codepage CP853 (especially as terminal encoding).
	To view and edit a file in Latin-3 encoding, select it from the 
	Encoding menu (submenu "more Latin"), or use the command line 
	parameter <code class=option>-E3</code>. To tell mined it runs a CP853 
	DOS setting, use a <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span> variable setting (<code>.CP853</code>) or 
	the option <code class=option>+E=CP853</code>.
	See <a href=#encodingflags>Character encoding</a> flags for details.
	<br><i>Terminal:</i> If your terminal runs this encoding, make 
	sure to indicate this properly with an environment variable 
	(<span class=env>LC_</span>* / <span class=env>LANG</span>).
	See <a href=#terminalenv>Terminal environment</a> for details.
<h4>Input method</h4>
	Mined supports a built-in input method for Esperanto, 
	using the "x-system", plus "Sm" for the Spesmilo sign.
	Select it from the Input method menu.
<h4>Accented character input support</h4>
	Instead of the input method, also the following accent prefix 
	functions can be used:

	<dl><dd><table class=ex>

	<tr><td>Ctrl-F6
		<dt>Ctrl-^
	<td>	circumflex
	<tr><td>Alt-Shift-F5
		<dt>Ctrl-(
	<td>breve

	</table></dl>

<!p><hr class=sep width=95%>
<h3>	Hawai'ian</h3>
<h4>Accented character and 'okina input support</h4>
	The following shortcuts and accent prefix functions can be used:

	<dl><dd><table class=ex>

	<tr><td>HOP ` <i>(grave accent)</i>
	<td>	glottal stop / 'okina (U+02BB)
	<tr><td>Alt-Ctrl-F6
		<dt>Ctrl-&ndash; <i>(Ctrl-minus)</i>
	<td>macron <i>(long vowel)</i>

	</table></dl>

	<i>Note:</i> In <a href=#smartquotes>smart quotes</a> mode, 
	the grave accent (or backquote) ` alone enters a glottal stop as well.

<!p><hr class=sep width=95%>
<h3>	Russian, Ukrainian, other Cyrillic-script languages</h3>
<h4>Character sets</h4>
	In addition to Unicode, mined supports ISO Cyrillic (ISO 8859-5), 
	Windows Cyrillic (CP1251), and KOI8-RU which is a convenient 
	merge of KOI8-R (Russian) and KOI8-U (Ukrainian) (which are 
	also supported separately but not included in the menu), 
	and DOS Ukrainian (CP1125 and CP1131).
	To view and edit a file in one of these encodings, select it 
	from the Encoding menu ("Cyrillic" or submenu "more NE Eurasian"), 
	or use the respective command line parameter.
	See <a href=#encodingflags>Character encoding</a> flags for details.
	<br><i>Terminal:</i> If your terminal runs any of these 
	encodings, make sure to indicate this properly with an 
	environment variable (<span class=env>LC_</span>* / <span class=env>LANG</span>).
	See <a href=#terminalenv>Terminal environment</a> for details.
<h4>Input method</h4>
	Mined supports a built-in input method for Cyrillic.
	Select it from the Input method menu.
<h4>Accented character input support</h4>
	In combination with a Cyrillic input method or keyboard, 
	mined provides accent prefix support for Cyrillic accented 
	letters. Accent prefix functions for Latin letters are reused 
	for Cyrillic accents, see the following table:

	<dl><dd><table class=ex>

	<tr><td>F5
		<dt>Ctrl-:
	<td>	diaeresis

<h4>Input method</h4>
	Mined supports a built-in input method for Greek.
	Select it from the Input method menu.
<h4>Accented character input support</h4>
	In combination with a Greek input method or keyboard, 
	mined provides accent prefix support for both monotonic Greek 
	and polytonic Greek.
	<br><b>Monotonic Greek</b> uses only one accent, the tonos which 
	looks like acute and can be entered with the F6 or Ctrl-' 
	prefix function.
	<br><b>Polytonic Greek</b> uses &ndash; among many others &ndash; 
	the oxia accent which is nowadays considered identical and looks 
	like the monotonic tonos. However, for historic reasons, there 
	are two sets of Greek accented letters with this accent in 
	Unicode, one with tonos and one with oxia. While this may be 
	considered a design flaw of Unicode, in fact both kinds of 
	characters exist and mined provides support for both accents.
	The choice of usage is up to the user.
	Note, e.g. that
	<dl><dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>F6 &lt alpha ></span>
		<dd>enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-F6 &lt alpha ></span>
		<dd>enters the Greek letter alpha with oxia
	</dl></dl>
	Likewise, with mnemonic input
	<dl><dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>^V ' &lt alpha > <i>(using the apostrophe key)</i></span>
		<dd>enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos
	<dt><span class=ex>^V ´ &lt alpha > <i>(using the acute accent key)</i></span>
	</dl></dl>
	In these examples, &lt alpha > indicates the Greek letter 
	alpha, which may e.g. be entered by selecting the Greek input 
	method and typing the a key.

	<p>
	Accent prefix functions for Latin letters are reused for Greek 
	accents, see the following table:

	<dl><dd><table class=ex>

	<tr><td>F5
		<dt>Ctrl-:
		<dt>Ctrl-"

	</table></dl>

	For polytonic Greek, 2 or 3 accents can be combined by 
	applying the respective accent prefix functions in sequence.
	For convenience, the most frequent combinations of 2 accents 
	are also available as dedicated accent prefix keys as listed 
	above.
	Also, modified Ctrl-/Alt-/Alt-Ctrl- digit keys are used for 
	polytonic Greek accent prefix functions.
	See <a href=#characterinputsupport>Character input support</a> 
	for more details.
<h4>Script highlighting</h4>
	To distinguish some Greek letters from Latin look-alikes,

	sure to indicate this properly with an environment variable 
	(<span class=env>LC_</span>* / <span class=env>LANG</span>).
	See <a href=#terminalenv>Terminal environment</a> for details.
<h4>Input method</h4>
	Mined provides the following built-in input methods for Vietnamese:
	VNI and VIQR.
	Select the input method of your preference from the Input method menu.
	<br>It may be more convenient, however, to use the extensive 
	accented character input support provided by mined together with 
	a normal Latin-based keyboard (so without a keyboard-mapping input 
	method), see Character input support for Vietnamese below.
<h4>Character input support</h4>
	Mined provides input support for multiple accented characters 
	as used in Vietnamese, as well as convenient accent prefix 
	functions for combinations of two Vietnamese accents.
	Modified Ctrl-/Alt-/Alt-Ctrl- digit keys are used for 
	Vietnamese accent prefix functions.
	Alternatively, mnemonic character input can be used.
	See <a href=#composedinput>Accented and mnemonic input support</a> 
	for details, and see below for some introducing comments.

	<p>An accent prefix can either be applied to the plain Latin base 
	letter, or to a precomposed Vietnamese letter which already has 
	one of the accents.
	These are:
	<ul>
	<dt><dd>U+00C2  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+00E2  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+00CA  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+00EA  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+00D4  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+00F4  LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX
	<dt><dd>U+0102  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE
	<dt><dd>U+0103  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH BREVE
	<dt><dd>U+01A0  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH HORN
	<dt><dd>U+01A1  LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH HORN
	<dt><dd>U+01AF  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH HORN
	<dt><dd>U+01B0  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH HORN
	</ul>
	<p>
	<p><i>Examples:</i> Suppose your keyboard is mapped to have 
	Vietnamese characters like A with circumflex available. Then:
	<dl><dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>^V Â ' (Ctrl-V A-circumflex apostrophe)</span>
	<dd>enters the composite character U+1EA4 (A with circumflex and acute)
	<dt><span class=ex>^V ~ Ô (Ctrl-V O-circumflex tilde)</span>
	<dd>enters the composite character U+1ED6 (O with circumflex and tilde)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-6 A</span>
	<dd>enters U+00C2 (A with circumflex)
	<dt><span class=ex>Alt-4 A</span>
	<dd>enters U+1EAA (A with circumflex and tilde)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-Alt-3 A</span>
	<dd>enters U+1EB2 (A with breve and hook above)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-Alt-3 O</span>
	<dd>enters U+1EDE (O with horn and hook above)
	</dl></dl>
	<i>Note:</i> Using composite base characters in mined 
	character mnemonics or accent prefix combinations as just 
	described also works in non-UTF-8 text encoding mode (e.g. in 
	VISCII or TCVN encoding).

<h2>Character handling support</h2>
<dl><dd>
	This chapter describes mined features for character 
	manipulation and display of characters and character 
	properties. Unicode and CJK specific features are described 
	in the respective chapters.
	<a href=#characterinputsupport>Character input support</a> is 
	described separately in the subsequent chapter.

<h3>	Script highlighting</h3>
<img align=right src=script-highlighting.png>
	It may be desirable to distinguish characters in different 
	script by displaying their glyphs in different colours.
	(This especially allows to distinguish easier between 
	similar glyphs as they occur in Latin/Greek/Cyrillic scripts.)
	<br>Script highlighting is currently pre-configured for 
	Greek and Cyrillic. It uses the terminal's 256-colour mode 
	if available.
	<br>The scripts to highlight and the colour values to use 
	can be configured at compile-time.
	See <a href=#minedconf>Mined configuration</a> below.

<a name=combined></a>
<h3>	Combining characters</h3>
	When editing text in Unicode or any encoding that contains 
	combining characters, mined supports display and editing of 
	combining and combined characters.
	<p>
	(<i>Note:</i> Terminal support for combining characters is 
	auto-detected; additional command line options are available 
	in case this fails.)
	<br>
	If mined operates on a terminal that handles combining 
	characters, it offers two editing modes: combined or separated.
	They can be toggled by clicking the Combining display flag 
	in the <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a> 
	area (right part of the top screen line), or by the menu entry 
	"Options &ndash; Combined display";
	separated display mode can also be selected by the command 
	line option <code class=option>-c</code>.
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Combined display and editing mode</i> (Combining display flag <code class=flag>ç</code>)
	<dd>
	Combined characters are displayed as intended (i.e., combined).
<br><img src=combined.png><br>
	<li><i>Micro movement</i> into combined characters:
	  <ul>
	  <li>The cursor can be moved into a combined character with 
	      Ctrl-cursor-left and Ctrl-cursor-right, 
	      or ^V cursor-left and ^V cursor-right.
	  <li>You can determine the exact position of the cursor if 
	      permanent character info is switched on (by HOP ESC u or 
	      with HOP "Toggle Char info" in the Options menu).
	  </ul>
	<li>Partially editing combined characters:
	  <ul>
	  <img src=combining.png><br>
	  <li>If the cursor is on a combined character, delete next character 
	      (e.g. Del on small keypad) will delete the whole 
	      combined character, with all combining accents.
	  <li>If the cursor is on a combined character, Ctrl-Del 
	      will delete only the base character, leaving combining 
	      accents which may then be combined with the previous 
	      character.
	  <li>If the cursor is within a combined character, delete next 
	      character will delete the current combining accent only.
	  <li><i>Smart backspacing:</i> Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow

	      will only delete the rightmost combining accent 
	      (preceding the cursor position) while Backarrow would 
	      delete the whole combined character.
		<br><i>Note:</i>Configuration option <code class=option>plain_BS</code> 
		(command line option <code class=option>+Bp</code>) 
		switches the Backarrow key from smart backspacing to 
		plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent and only delete 
		one combining character of a combined character.
		Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing then.
	  <li>You can also position the cursor as described above and use 
	      copy-and-paste operations.
	  </ul>
	<dd><i>Note:</i> Ctrl-cursor-left and Ctrl-cursor-right

<h3>	Character information display</h3>
	The command ESC u displays character encoding information in the 
	bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); it displays the 
	character code in the selected encoding (UTF-8 byte sequence 
	in UTF-8 mode) and the ISO-10646 (Unicode) value of the 
	current character, as well as Unicode script range and 
	character category, width, and combining information.
	The Unicode value is displayed with 4 hexadecimal digits if 
	the character is in the Unicode BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane, 
	16 bit), with 6 digits if it is a Unicode character outside of 
	the BMP, and 8 digits if it is an ISO-10646 character outside 
	of the Unicode range.
	The information displayed also indicates all kinds of 
	encoding irregularities.
	<br>For the Unicode data version used for character properties 
	see the mined change log.
	<p>Permanent display of character information is toggled 
	with HOP ESC u or by selecting "Char info" in the Info menu 
	(or with HOP "Toggle Char info" in the Options menu).
	<p>In the Info menu, attributes that are shown with the character 
	information can be selected:
	Unicode script name, Unicode character name,
	Unicode named sequence, 
	Unicode character decomposition, list of input mnemonics.
	Note that Unicode named sequence information only applies to a 
	small number of named sequences, otherwise normal character 
	information is shown instead; also, it is only shown in combined 
	display mode, so normal information can be quickly toggled by 
	switching to separated display mode (middle-click on 
	<code class=flag>ç</code> flag).
	<p>Character information display can be selected with the 
	<code class=option>+?c</code> command line parameter (see 
	parameter description for further options).
	To preselect continuous character information display, append 
	<code class=option>+?c</code> to the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDOPT</span> 
	or enable option "display_charinfo" in the runtime configuration file 
	<code class=path>$HOME/.minedrc</code>.

<h4>Han character information display</h4>
	CJK-specific character information (semantic and pronuciation 
	hints) is described below in section <a href=#haninfo>
	Han character information display</a>.

<h3>	Character conversion features</h3>

<a name=caseconv></a>
<h4>Case conversion</h4>
	The case conversion functions (ESC C, HOP ESC C, F11, HOP F11, 
	Shift-F3) cover the full Unicode range.
	They also handle special cases like Greek final sigma, 
	optionally Turkish "i", case mapping to multiple characters, 
	and Lithuanian special conditions.
	Japanese characters are toggled between Hiragana and Katakana 
	by the same functions.
	<br>
	Shift-F3 cycles casing of a word between all small, title case 
	(beginning capital), and all capitals. It handles title casing, 
	using Unicode title case characters for the first character 
	when appropriate.
	For Japanese script, it toggles the word between Hiragana and 
	Katakana.
	<br>The case mapping is based on the most recent Unicode 
	version compiled into mined (for the actual version see the 
	mined change log and the Options menu About command).
	It is applicable in all text encodings.

<h4>Line end type conversion</h4>
	In the Options menu, a submenu "Lineend type..." offers functions 
	to convert the line end of the current line to LF or CRLF, 
	or to convert the line end type of all lines that do not have 
	a special line end to LF or CRLF.

<h4>Numeric conversion</h4>
	Commands are available to insert characters corresponding to 
	a hexadecimal character code or hexadecimal/octal/decimal 
	Unicode value contained in the text, to insert a 
	respective value corresponding to the current character, or 
	to toggle the preceding character and its hexadecimal Unicode value (Alt-x).
	For details, see the section 
	<a href=#codecmds>Code conversion</a> in the Command reference.

<h4>Numeric entity (HTML/URL) conversion</h4>
	HTML numeric character entities (e.g. &amp;#x40; or &amp;#64; for @) or 
	URL escape notation (e.g. %20 for space, %C3%86 for Æ) 
	can be converted into unescaped characters. Use one of the 
	<a href=#mnemonictrans>Mnemonic character substitution commands</a> 
	(ESC _ or national variants) described below.

<h4>Mnemonic conversion</h4>
	A character mnemonic at the cursor position can be replaced with 
	its associated character. Use one of the 
	<a href=#mnemonictrans>Mnemonic character substitution commands</a> 
	(ESC _ or national variants) described below.

<h4>Encoding conversion support</h4>
	A special feature offers interactive conversion to or from 
	Unicode character encoding, see 
	<a href=#encodingconv>Encoding conversion support</a> in 
	chapter <a href=#unicode>Unicode support below</a>.

<h4>Unicode Copy/Paste buffer</h4>
	The Copy/Paste buffer can be operated in Unicode mode in 
	which case it converts between text edited in different 
	character encodings.
	See <a href=#unicodebuffer>Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion</a> 
	below.

<a name=smartquotes></a>
<h3>	Smart quotes</h3>
<img align=right src=quotes.png>
	In Smart quotes mode, straight (double or single) quote 
	characters «"» or «'» are automatically substituted with an 
	opening or closing typographic quotation mark, depending on 
	the text context, or an apostrophe where appropriate.
	Also, an acute accent key enters a typographic apostrophe.
	Alt-" or Alt-' enter the respective quotation marks of the 
	previous or standby style (see below).
	<br>
	Quote marks style selection:
	<ul>
	<li>Select the quotation marks style to be applied from the 
	Smart Quotes selection menu (open with ESC Q or Alt-Q or 
	right-click on the smart quotes indication in the flags area 
	in the top screen line).
	<li>To toggle between the current and the previous smart quotes style, 
	middle-click or double-click the smart quotes flag or select 
	"standby" from the menu.
	<li>To select the smart quotes style suitable for the current locale, 
	select "by locale" from the menu. This is also achieved with the 
	configuration option <code class=option>smart_quotes</code> or 
	the command line option <code class=option>-q</code>.
	</ul>
	<br>Quotation marks style can be preselected by either of the 
	mechanisms described below.
	<p>
	The smart quotes left/right selection algorithm considers both 
	the text context and the state (whether an open quote was 
	inserted before) to automatically support smart quotes also in 
	CJK text, and to try to distinguish an apostrophe from a quote mark.
	At a line beginning, always a left (opening) quotation mark is 
	chosen, supporting the habit in some languages to repeat 
	opening quote marks for each new paragraph inside a quotation.
	<br>
	French quotation marks spacing is automatically applied (using 
	no-break space U+00A0) if French style has been selected from 
	the menu or by locale.
	<br>
	A typographic apostrophe can also be inserted with HOP ' (^G ') 
	or with HOP ´ (acute accent), regardless of smart quotes mode.
	In smart quotes mode, a typographic apostrophe is also inserted on 
	input of ´ (acute accent).
	<br>
	Straight quotes or accent marks (" ' ` ´) can be inserted with 
	mnemonic compose pairs (<code>^V ^ "</code> or <code>^V ^ '</code> 
	or <code>^V ^ `</code> or <code>^V ^ ´</code>, or <code>^V"#</code> 
	or <code>^V'#</code> or <code>^V`#</code> or <code>^V´#</code> 
	respectively).
	<br>
	Smart quotes are applicable in all text encodings provided 
	the desired quote marks are contained in the selected encoding.
	<p>
	When a file is loaded, mined tries to determine the applicable 
	quotation marks style in two ways: With file position memory (see 
	<a href=#memory>File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters</a>
	above), mined also remembers the last selected smart quotes 
	mode for the file.
	If that information is not available, mined auto-detects 
	existing quotation marks in the file and adjusts its smart 
	quotes mode accordingly. The option <code class=option>-q</code> 
	overrides this detection.
	<p>With command-line option <code class=option>-q</code> alone, 
	quotation marks style is derived from locale information 
	(environment variables 
	<span class=env>LANGUAGE</span>, 
	<span class=env>TEXTLANG</span>, <span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, 
	<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, <span class=env>LANG</span>), or from a locale 
	value given with the option as <code class=option>-q=<i>locale</i></code>.
	For some languages, two styles are predefined, using the primary 
	style as active smart quotes style, and the secondary or alternate 
	style as standby style, for quick toggling with a middle mouse click 
	on the Quotes flag 
	(or using the standby entry from the Quote marks menu).
	The active quote marks style can also be derived explicitly 
	from the locale with the Quotes menu option "by locale".
	<br>Option <code class=option>+q</code> exchanges primary and 
	alternate quotation marks style, setting the alternate style active.
	<br>Without an option <code class=option>-q</code>, the primary 
	locale-derived quote marks style is always set as standby style 
	to be quickly available.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Language-dependent quotations marks styles 
	are determined using the compile-time configuration file 
	<code class=path>quotes.cfg</code>.
	See <a href=quotesdoc.html>Quotation Marks Styles</a> 
	on the mined web site for a listing.
	<br><i>Note:</i> 
	Smart quotes style can also be preselected giving the desired 
	quotation marks directly, either as command line option like 
	<code class=option>-q="«»"</code> or with the environment 
	variable <a href=#smartquotesconf><span class=env>MINEDQUOTES</span></a> 
	(see under Environment configuration hints below);
	this overrides both auto-detection and the preference 
	saved with the cursor position.

<h4>Smart text replacements: apostrophe, smart dashes, arrows and glottal stop</h4>
	<dd>If smart quotes are active, some other smart input text 
	replacements are applied to respective characters being entered.
	(Replacement of subsequent character input sequences is suppressed 
	during a repeat command entering multiple characters.)
	<dl><dd><table name=smartreplacements border=0>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td width=30><code>--</code>
		<td><i>if preceded by a Space character:</i> en dash (U+2013)

	<tr valign=top>
		<td width=30><code>- </code> <i>or</i> <code>-TAB</code>

		<td>apostrophe (U+2019 right single quotation mark)
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><code>`</code>
		<td>glottal stop (U+02BB modifier letter turned comma)
	</table></dl>
	<dd><i>Note:</i> Mined smartly avoids inappropriate placement of smart replacements 
	as well as double spaces by redundant combination of smart spaces 
	and explicitly entered spaces, so you can seamlessly type either 
	<code class=ex>"bonjour"</code> or <code class=ex>" bonjour "</code> 
	to enter <code class=ex>« bonjour »</code> with French quotes, or 
	<code class=ex>a -- b</code> to enter an en dash although a space is 
	initially inserted after it.

<h2>Character input support</h2>
<dl><dd>

	Some character input support features support international 
	scripts (especially with <a href=#keymap>Keyboard Mapping and 
	Input Methods</a>), others mainly address composite characters.
	For the latter, it is useful to explain a few notions:
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Combining character:</i>
	<dd>A character (usually in Unicode) that is defined to combine 
	with the previous character into a combined character, to be 
	displayed as a single glyph (visual unit).
	<dt><i>Combined character:</i>
	<dd>The glyph combination of a Unicode character (base character) 
	with one or more Unicode combining characters.
	<dt><i>Composed character (or composite character):</i>
	<dd>A character that has one or more accents composed 
	into it, or is otherwise composed of components, like the ae 
	ligature, to be displayed as a single glyph. It can be a 
	single Unicode character or a Unicode combined character 
	consisting of a Unicode base character and one or two Unicode 
	combining characters.
	<dt><i>Accented character (or diacritic character):</i>
	<dd>A special case of a composite character where a letter is 
	composed with one or more accents.
	<dt><i>Compose key:</i>
	<dd>A number of system and keyboard vendors have equipped 
	their keyboards with a "Compose" or "Combine" key. This key &ndash; 
	when configured and interpreted properly by the operating 
	environment &ndash; produces a composed character which is then 
	provided as input to the application.
	</dl>

<a name=composedinput></a>
<h3>	Accented and mnemonic input support</h3>
	Function keys or character mnemonics can be used to 
	enter accented or other composite characters.
	(This is also known as digraph function with some editors.)
	<br>
	These character composition functions also work on the prompt line.
	<br>
	(Any composite character configured on your keyboard can of 
	course also be entered directly or using the Compose/Combine 
	key of your keyboard.)

	<p>
	<dl><dt>
	Note that mnemonic input and accent prefix keys can be 
	combined in flexible ways, e.g.
	<dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>^V ' Ctrl-F6 e</span>
		<dd>or
	<dt><span class=ex>F6 ^V e ^</span>
		<dd>which both enter U+1EBF (e with circumflex and acute)
	</dl></dl>

	<p>
	<dd><dl><dt>
	Mnemonic input can be applied recursively to compose a character 
	for further composition, e.g.
	<dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>^V ' ^V a e</span>
		<dd>enters U+01FD (æ with acute)
	</dl></dl>

	<p>
	<dl><dt>
	Accent prefix keys can use an already precomposed base 
	character for further composition; if this does not match an 
	explicitly known mnemonic, the base character is decomposed 
	first to find a match, e.g.
	<dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>F6 ü</span>
		<dd>or
	<dt><span class=ex>F5 ú</span>
		<dd>which both enter U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)
	</dl></dl>

	<p>
	<dl><dt>
	Up to three accent prefix keys can be combined by entering 
	them in sequence in order to compose characters with multiple 
	accents, e.g.
	<dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>F5 F6 u</span>
		<dd>enters U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-2 Ctrl-7 a</span>
		<dd>enters U+1EB1 (a with grave and breve)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-&ndash; Ctrl-: u</span>
		<dd>enters U+1E7B (u with macron and diaeresis)
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-, Ctrl-( e</span>
		<dd>enters U+1E1D (e with cedilla and breve)
	<dt><span class=ex>Alt-7 Ctrl-, &lt alpha ></span>
	<dt><span class=ex>Alt-F6 Shift-F6 Ctrl-, &lt alpha ></span>
	<dt><span class=ex>Ctrl-&lt Ctrl-` Ctrl-, &lt alpha ></span>
		<dd>all enter U+1F82 (alpha with psili and varia and ypogegrammeni)
		<dd>where &lt alpha > indicates the Greek letter 
		alpha, which may e.g. be entered by selecting the 
		Greek input method and typing the "<code>a</code>" key

	<b><i>General notes on using keys with Control, Shift, Alt modifiers:</i></b>
	Especially for accented character input, mined makes use of 
	key combinations modified with Control, Shift, Alt, or a 
	combination of them.
	Some of these key combinations may be limited by local 
	environment, especially the window system, or may need 
	extra configuration to be enabled.
	<ul>
	<li><b><i>Hint on input of Alt/Ctrl-modified function keys:</i></b>
	These are often intercepted by window systems for special 
	functions.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Alt:</b> Alternatively to using the Alt key, 
	the ESC key can be used as a prefix to a function key to achieve 
	the same modified function, e.g. ESC F6 instead of Alt-F6.
	Note, however, that there is an ESCAPE delay (default 450 ms) 
	during which the subsequent function key should be pressed.
	<li><b>Control:</b> Alternatively to using the Control key, 
	Ctrl-V can be used as a prefix to a function key to achieve 
	the same modified function, e.g. Ctrl-V F6 instead of Ctrl-F6.
	</ul>
	<br>Specific advice:

	</table></dl>
	<li>Modified digit keys (e.g. Alt-2) as well as 
	Ctrl-modified punctuation keys (e.g. Ctrl-;) 
	are used as extended and intuitive accent prefix keys.
	To enable them, either use a recent version of xterm (216) or 
	configure them with your terminal.
	<br>Configuration instructions for older versions of xterm and 
	for rxvt can be found in the sample file 
	<code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the <a href=#support>Mined 
	runtime support library</a>.
	<li>Note: In rxvt, Ctrl-modified and shifted punctuation keys 
	(if enabled by configuration following the hint above) 
	interfere with ISO 14755 input mode of rxvt; if the following 
	key is entered twice, that mode is aborted and the modified 
	punctuation key becomes effective as an accent prefix in mined.
	<li><b>Warning:</b> The Alt-F4 key combination should not

<h3>	Character input mnemonics</h3>
	The enter-control-code prefix (^V by default, ^Q in emacs 
	keyboard mode, ^_ in Windows and pico keyboard modes, ^P in 
	WordStar keyboard mode) can be used for mnemonic character 
	composition.
	This covers accented characters and other mnemonics.
	The available mnemonics include RFC1345 mnemonics (extended 
	to provide generic accent mnemonics for Unicode characters), 
	mnemonics known from HTML and TeX,
	groff glyphs (roff special characters), and useful supplementary mnemonics.
	See <a href=mnemodoc.html>Character Mnemos reference</a> on 
	the mined web site for a listing.
	<br>Supplementary character mnemonics are consistent with generic 
	RFC1345 mnemonics; scripts covered are Latin, Greek, Cyrillic.
	<p>
	For accent compositions, <i>mnemonic patterns</i> 
	(generic accent mnemonics) are listed in the following table;
	the respective letter to place the accent(s) on is indicated 
	with an "<code>x</code>" below.
	<p>
	For Greek and Cyrillic accented characters, mnemonics combining 
	accents with Greek or Cyrillic base characters are generated 
	automatically from the UnicodeData.txt database.
	<br>Greek and Cyrillic accent prefix keys reuse those for 
	Latin accents and are listed in the sections on Greek and Cyrillic 
	script support (see <a href=#languagesupport>Language support</a>).

<h3>	Keyboard Mapping and Input Methods</h3>
	Mined supports optional keyboard mapping which is especially 
	useful for Unicode or CJK editing.
	When a keyboard mapping is selected, input characters or 
	sequences are transformed to other characters or sequences, 
	typically of a certain Unicode script range.
	<br>
	Keyboard mappings for Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and 
	major CJK input methods are preconfigured (they have been 
	ordered in the Input Method menu according to the order of 
	their respective basic ranges in the Unicode character set, or 
	to the order of the letters of the usual abbreviation CJKV for 
	East Asian text processing &ndash; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
	Vietnamese). The <a href=#radicalstroke>Radical/Stroke input 
	method</a> provides additional functionality as a special case.
	<br>
	Mined provides compile-time configuration of additional input 
	methods; for this aim, further mappings can be generated using the 
	<a href=#mkkbmap><code>mkkbmap</code></a> script (from tables 
	in various formats as used by other editors or supplied by the 
	m17n multilingualization package) and then compiled into mined.
	See <a href=#minedconf>Mined configuration</a> below for details.

	<p>
	Keyboard mapping works as follows: You enter a key sequence 
	that is mapped to a character sequence in the selected 
	keyboard mapping table. The transformed character sequence is 
	used as input.
	<br>As some typical keyboard mappings contain ambigous key 
	sequences where one may be a prefix of another, a short delay 
	is applied in these cases to allow recognition of any such 
	sequence to be mapped. After a timeout, the shorter sequence 
	already matching will be used; the timeout can be cut short by 
	typing a Space key, the Space character itself will then be 
	discarded. (The timeout value is 900 ms by default and can be 
	configured with the environment variable <span class=env>MAPDELAY</span>.)

	<h4>Pick lists</h4>
	Some keyboard mappings, especially for CJK input methods, 
	contain multiple choice mappings. In these cases, a selection 
	menu is displayed that offers a "pick list" to select a 
	character from. A character can be picked with a mouse click, 
	or by navigation to the desired choice with the cursor keys 
	(down/up, right/left, page down/up) or the '&lt'/'>' keys , or 
	by just selecting the menu row first (cursor-up/down), then 
	typing a digit 1-9 or 0 to select the numbered character.
	<br>The Space key can be configured to either navigate to the 
	next choice, the next row, or to select the current choice; 
	see option <a href=#optionK><code class=option>-K</code></a>.
<img align=right src=picklist.png>
	<br clear=all>If the pick list is too large to fit on the screen, 
	the menu will be scrollable or pageable (using cursor keys).
	<p>While navigating through the pick list, the line and the 
	selected item in the line are highlighted accordingly; if 
	the current item is a CJK character, also its character 
	information (description and optionally pronunciations as 
	configured with the <a href=#haninfo>Han info</a> option of 
	the '?' information flag menu) is displayed on the status 
	line. If the item is a word comprising multiple CJK characters, 
	the information for only the first of them is shown. The 
	available information is derived from the Unihan database.
	<p>
	Keyboard mapping data are based on Unicode. So in CJK text 
	mode, the selection menu (the pick list) may contain symbols 
	that are not mapped to the active CJK text encoding. In a 
	UTF-8 terminal, these will still be displayed but cannot be 
	inserted. In a CJK terminal, some characters may not be 
	displayed; an empty entry is shown instead. (In a non-Unicode, 
	when editing text in a different encoding, there may even 
	be characters that cannot be displayed in the selection menu 
	but can be inserted.)

	<h4>Input method selection</h4>
	An active and a standby input method (keyboard mapping) are 
	maintained. They can be toggled quickly for text input, also 
	on the prompt line.
	<br>The current mapping is indicated as the Input Method flag 
	by its two-letter script tag in the flags area, showing
	"<code class=reverse>--</code>" if no mapping is active.
	<p>
	The active mapping can be selected in the following ways:
	<dl><dd><dl>
	<dt><span class=ex>ESC k <i>or</i> Alt-k <i>or</i> Ctrl-Alt-F12 <i>or</i> left click on Input Method flag</span>
		<dd>toggles between current (active) and previously 
		selected (standby) input method (keyboard mapping)
		<br>(Alt- toggle functions also work on prompt line)
	<dt><span class=ex>HOP ESC k (or HOP Alt-k)</span>
		<dd>clears input method, i.e. resets keyboard mapping 
		to none (unmapped input)
	<dt><span class=ex>ESC I <i>or</i> Alt-I <i>or</i> ESC K <i>or</i> Alt-K <i>or</i> Ctrl-F12</span>
		<dd>opens the Input Method (Keyboard Mapping) selection menu
		<br>(Alt-I or Alt-K or Ctrl-F12 also work on prompt line)
	<dt><span class=ex>right click on Input Method flag</span>
		<dd>opens the Input Method selection menu
	<dt><span class=ex>HOP ESC K <i>or</i> HOP Alt-K</span>
		<dd>cycles through available input methods / keyboard mappings
	</dl></dl>
<p>	If file position memory is enabled (see 
	<a href=#memory>File info: Memory of file position and editing style parameters</a>
	above), mined also remembers the last selected input method 
	for the file.
<p>
	<i>Note:</i> For preselecting the active or standby input method 
	by environment configuration, see about usage of the 
	environment variable <a href=#MINEDKEYMAP><span class=env>MINEDKEYMAP</span></a> below.
<p>
	<i>Note:</i> Keyboard mapping is implicitly suppressed temporarily 
	where it is not useful: during mnemonic character input, HTML 
	marker input, command letter entry, help selection, yes/no prompting.

<h3>	CJK and mapped 8 bit encoding support</h3>
	Mined supports major CJK encodings as well as mapped 
	8 bit encodings ("character sets").
	Mined has built-in support for a large number of 8 bit encodings 
	which appear to be in use or unique for a region. The Encoding 
	menu has been structured with submenus to provide a concise 
	menu selection feature.

<a name=ebcdic></a>
<h3>	EBCDIC support</h3>
	Mined supports EBCDIC encoded files (transparently transforming 
	them for internal handling) in the "bracket" codepage CP1047 as 
	used by the UNIX System Services (USS) on IBM z/OS.
	CP1047 is selected with command line option 
	<code class=option>-E=cp1047</code> or 
	<code class=option>-E.EBCDIC</code> or 
	<code class=option>-E:47</code>.
	The character encoding flag indicates EBCDIC with 
	"<code class=reverse>47</code>".
	<br>New files in EBCDIC encoding will by default use Next Line 
	as line separators; add option <code class=option>-r</code> 
	to prefer LF.
	<br>New lines can be added selecting LF or NL lineend type 
	explicitly with Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter.
	<br><img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2022.26>
	Auto-detection of EBCDIC can be enabled by including the letter 
	"E" in the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDDETECT</span>.

<a name=iso6937></a>
<h3>	<img align=absmiddle src=new-rot.gif title=2022.26>ISO 6937 support</h3>

	ISO 6937 is selected with command line option 
	<code class=option>-E=ISO-6937</code> or 
	<code class=option>-E:I9</code>.
	The character encoding flag indicates ISO 6937 with 
	"<code class=reverse>I9</code>".

<h3>	Combining characters</h3>
	In all character encodings handled by mined that contain 
	combining characters, mined handles them and provides partial 
	editing and an optional separated display mode as described 
	above in section <a href=#combined> Combining characters</a>.
	(CJK encodings EUC-JIS-2004, Shift_JIS-2004 and GB18030, 
	Vietnamese TCVN and Windows Vietnamese (CP1258), Thai TIS-620, 
	ISO Arabic, Mac Arabic, DOS Arabic, ISO Hebrew, Windows Hebrew).
	Handling of combining text characters is properly coordinated 
	with the set of combining characters supported by the terminal.
	<p>
	For Japanese X 0213 encodings, the character codes that map to 
	two Unicode characters are supported.

<h3>	Character code related commands</h3>
	The command ESC u displays character encoding information in the 
	bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); this includes 
	the character code, the mapped Unicode character value, 
	and optionally script and character category information, 
	character and named sequence name, 
	combining and Unicode decomposition information, 
	and mined mnemonic input information, as configured in the Info menu.
	For CJK characters, also Han pronunciation and description 
	information is available.
	See <a href=#charinfo>Character information display</a> for details.
	<br>With HOP ESC u, permanent display is toggled.
	<p>Other commands insert the code of the current character, 
	insert a character taking its character code or Unicode value 
	from the text, or toggle the preceding character and its 
	hexadecimal Unicode value (Alt-x).
	For details, see <a href=#codecmds>Code conversion</a> in the 
	Command reference.

<h3>	Terminal environment for CJK encoding support</h3>
	<dl>
	Mined supports handling of CJK text encoding in any terminal 
	(see <a href=#terminalencoding>Terminal encoding support</a> below).
	However, proper display of a wide range of CJK characters can 
	obviously only work in either a Unicode terminal (recommended) 
	or in a native CJK terminal that runs the same encoding as the 
	selected text encoding.

	<p>CJK terminals:
	<dd>For terminals that support native CJK encodings 
	(e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm), the terminal encoding assumed by 
	mined can be specified with a command line option or by proper 
	locale indication in one of the environment variables <span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, 
	<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span> or <span class=env>LANG</span>.
	For available encodings, see <a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a>.
	For usage of the <code class=option>+E</code> options, see the 
	description of the <a href=#termencodingoption>Terminal 
	encoding options</a> above.
	For usage of the locale environment variables, see 
	<a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
	<p><i>Note:</i> In native CJK terminals, it is often troublesome 
	to find a working encoding configuration and font setup, and 
	the locale environment is not automatically set by the terminals.
	A collection of wrapper scripts is available 
	(<a href=http://towo.net/mined/terminals.tar.gz>
	http://towo.net/mined/terminals.tar.gz</a>) to help with this 
	setup problem and demonstrate the invocation of a number of 
	different CJK and 8 bit encoded terminal windows, along with 
	selection of suitable fonts and proper locale environment 
	setting.
	<p><i>Note:</i> Native CJK terminals have a different 
	assumption of the range of character codes supported in an 
	encoding family, e.g. Big5 / Big5 with HKSCS, GB2312 / GBK / 
	GB18030, EUC-KR / UHC, EUC-JP without/with 3 byte codes.
	For compact handling, mined always assumes the largest superset 
	of these encoding families. It does, however, have some features 
	to prevent display garbage in most cases when a terminal supports 
	a smaller character set:
	<dl>By default, mined does not display the following CJK 
	character codes in a native CJK terminal, i.e. it displays a 
	substitute indication for them
	(see <a href=#cjkdisplay>CJK character display</a> above):
	<ul>
	<li>Unknown characters: CJK characters that have no defined 
	mapping to a valid Unicode character.
	Use the <code class=option>+C</code> option to override this 
	display suppression and enforce transparent display of unknown 
	characters in a CJK terminal.
	<li>Invalid characters: CJK characters that do not match the 
	encoding scheme (e.g. wrt. to specified byte ranges) of the 
	selected encoding.
	Use the <code class=option>+CC</code> option to override this 
	display suppression and enforce transparent display of invalid 
	character codes in a CJK terminal.
	<li>Extended characters: CJK characters encoded with 3 or 
	4 bytes.
	Use the <code class=option>+CCC</code> option to override this 
	display suppression and enforce transparent display of extended 
	character codes in a CJK terminal.
	</ul>
	</dl>
	Regardless of all these features and options, it may not 
	always be possible to prevent display garbage, especially 
	if the font used by the terminal does not cover the needed 
	character range.
	To avoid these problems in general, it is recommended to use 
	a Unicode terminal for editing CJK encoded files.

	<p>See also <a href=#terminalinterworking>Terminal interworking 
	problems</a> for special hints about certain terminals.
	</dl>

<h3>	VT100 special graphics character set display support</h3>
	Mined can display and edit files containing codes for 
	VT100 line drawing graphics characters, showing corresponding 
	small letters as their respective graphic symbol.
	This option can be toggled from the Options menu and will 
	be cleared also on an explicit screen redraw command (ESC .).

<h2>Unicode support</h2>
<dl><dd>
<h3>	Introduction: handling Unicode encodings</h3>
	Mined interprets UTF-8 which is a multi-byte character 
	encoding of the ISO-10646 character set, part of which is also 
	known as Unicode.
	When reading a file, it detects UTF-8 encoding automatically 
	(unless overridden by explicitly selecting a text encoding with 
	a command line option <code class=option>-u</code> or 
	<code class=option>-l</code> or <code class=option>-E...</code>).
	It can also edit UTF-16 encoded Unicode files (UTF-16 can 
	represent the complete 21 bit Unicode subset of ISO-10646).
	UTF-16 big or little endian with or without BOM (byte order 
	mark U+FEFF) is auto-detected or can be selected with a 
	command-line option (see 
	<a href=#utf16>notes under Locale configuration</a> below).
	<br>
	UTF-16 is maintained transparently, i.e. a UTF-16 encoded file 
	is written back in UTF-16, and if it was beginning with a BOM 
	this is maintained.
	No explicit UTF-16 entry exists, however, in the Encoding menu 
	since the text is internally handled in UTF-8. However, the 
	character encoding flag indicates UTF-16 file encoding with either 
	"<code class=reverse>16</code>" (big endian) or 
	"<code class=reverse>61</code>" (little endian).

<h3>	UTF-8 internal representation, transparent handling of other text</h3>
	Mined handles UTF-8 representation internally and also edits 
	and keeps illegal UTF-8 sequences. This way, if you 
	happen to open a Latin-1 or CJK or any other encoded file 
	in UTF-8 mode, or switch encoding while editing, or edit a 
	file with mixed encoding, the text contents can still be 
	edited and you will not loose any file contents information.

<h3>	Character encoding indication</h3>
	The upper-right flags area has a character encoding indication 
	which shows "<code class=reverse>U8</code>" if UTF-8 
	text interpretation is selected. For Latin-1 text interpretation 
	"<code class=reverse>L1</code>" is shown, for others see 
	<a href=#flags>Quick Options (Mode indication) flags</a>.
	You may click on the indication flag to toggle between the 
	current and the previous selected encoding.

<h3>	Character information display</h3>
	The <a href=#charinfo>Character information display</a> 
	command ESC u is described above; character information display 
	can also be preselected by environment configuration.
	In UTF-8 mode, information shown includes the UTF-8 encoding 
	byte sequence.

<a name=unicodecharacterinputsupport></a>
<h3>	Character input support</h3>
	With ^V, mined's special character input support is invoked 
	(both while editing text and entering text on the prompt line, 
	e.g. as a search expression).
	With this feature, (in addition to plain control characters) 
	a composite character can be entered by its accent combination 
	or other mnemonic character description;
	a more-than-two letter character mnemonics would be embedded 
	in space characters after the ^V.
	In addition, numeric character codes or values can be entered 
	with leading ^V#, octal/decimal with ^V##/^V#=, Unicode with 
	optional u/U/+.
	(For examples, see description of the
	<a href=#controlv>^V function</a> below.)
	With numeric character input, mined supports <i>successive 
	multiple character entry</i> according to ISO 14755; if the 
	numeric code is terminated by a Space key, another numeric 
	character can be entered subsequently; an Enter key 
	terminates numeric character input.
	<p>
	See also the generic section 
	<a href=#characterinputsupport>Character input support</a> above 
	for input support for accented characters and keyboard mapping.

<a name=encodingconv></a>
<h3>	Encoding conversion support</h3>
	Two functions support interactive character encoding conversion 
	(Latin-1 to UTF-8 or UTF-8 to current encoding) 
	to partially fix files with mixed encoding.
	In either text encoding mode, the search function looks for 
	characters encoded in UTF-8 (when not editing in UTF-8 mode) 
	or not (when editing in UTF-8 mode); the command is 
	HOP ESC ( or Alt-F11 .
	Then, convert the character with ESC _ or its national variant 
	(see <a href=#mnemonictrans>mnemonic character substitution 
	commands</a> in the Command reference).
	<br>
	For repeated interactive conversion, both functions can be 
	combined into Alt-Shift-F11 (convert current character, then 
	search next).

<a name=unicodebuffer></a>
<h4>Unicode Copy/Paste buffer conversion</h4>
	For the Copy/Paste buffer, Unicode mode can be selected which 
	maintains its contents always in Unicode, so that Copy/Paste 
	of text works between differently encoded files (or sections 
	of a file, if encoding is switched while editing) with automatic 
	character code conversion.
	This mode is only effective while editing with non-Unicode 
	encoded text interpretation.
	<br>Select this mode with the command line option 
	<code class=option>-Eu</code> or in the Paste buffer menu 
	(righ-click on the Buffer mode flag "<code class=flag>=</code>" or 
	"<code class=reverse>+</code>") and select "Unicode".
	<br>Unicode buffer mode is indicated by cyan background of the 
	Paste buffer flag (then "<code class=unispecial>=</code>" or 
	"<code class=unispecial>+</code>"), except in Unicode text mode.

<h3>	Smart quotes and dashes</h3>
	If smart quotes mode is enabled (see the Quotes style menu under 
	the Quotes flag left to the Encoding flag and menu), quote mark 
	keys will enter typographic smart quotes instead. Smart dashes 
	also apply.
	See <a href=#smartquotes>Smart quotes</a> above for more details.

<a name=bidi></a>
<h3>	Bidirectional terminal support</h3>
	A bidirectional terminal (such as mintty, mlterm) will probably 
	also apply Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining. Mined auto-detects 
	this feature and enables bidi terminal handling automatically.
	Otherwise, bidi terminal handling can be configured with the 
	option <code class=option>+UU</code>.
	<br>In this mode, when displaying a menu, underlying text 
	lines that contain right-to-left characters are cleared first 
	in order to prevent display confusion between the terminal's 
	bidi algorithm and the menu position.
	<br>Also, with bidi terminal handling enabled, mined assumes 
	that the terminal applies Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining 
	and properly accounts for this feature in display position 
	handling.
	<br>In separated display mode, the joining part of the ligature 
	is indicated similar to the handling of combining characters.

<a name=righttoleft></a>
<h3>	Input support for right-to-left scripts ("poor man's bidi" mode)</h3>
	This support feature for input of right-to-left text pieces 
	is enabled by default unless the terminal is detected to be 
	in bidi mode itself (e.g. mlterm).
	<br>"Poor man's bidi" mode is suitable to insert small pieces of 
	right-to-left text (words, phrases) within left-to-right text, 
	it stores right-to-left text in visual order (see below) 
	and works as follows:
	<br>
	After entering a right-to-left Unicode character, the cursor 
	position is moved left of it, so subsequent characters will be 
	appended left and the text shifted right. Characters are 
	stored in visual order while input support is implicit, based 
	on the characters being typed. Entering a left-to-right 
	character will automatically skip behind the previously 
	entered right-to-left text on the line 
	and switch to left-to-right direction; this behaviour 
	optimizes inserting small pieces of right-to-left text into 
	basically left-to-right text; this priority is justified by 
	the assumption that this mode (with visual storing order) is 
	only useful for inserting small right-to-left quotations into 
	left-to-right text and not for editing right-to-left documents 
	(which should be stored in logical order).
	<br>
	Newline, Space, Tab, and combining characters attempt to 
	behave well according to what was entered before; however, 
	intermediate cursor movement is not considered.
	<br><i>Note:</i> For proper support of right-to-left text 
	editing stored in logical order, please use mined in a 
	right-to-left terminal (mintty, mlterm). Adding a feature for 
	advanced bidi support in all terminals is being considered.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Poor man's bidi mode also works in non-Unicode text encodings.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Poor man's bidi mode is similar to the "revins" 
	(reverse insert) option of vim.

<a name=unicodelineends></a>
<h3>	Unicode line ends</h3>
	Mined detects and handles Unicode line separators and 
	paragraph separators (unless disabled with 
	<code class=option>+u-u</code>).
	They are displayed as shown <a href=#visible>above</a>.
	Interpretation of these characters as line ends is disabled if 
	a file is explicitly opened in non-Unicode encoding (but not 
	if non-Unicode encoding is just auto-detected).
	<br>If editing Unicode text, HOP Enter will insert a Unicode 
	paragraph separator, Enter in a line that already has a 
	Unicode line end will insert a Unicode line separator.
	Also, the keys Shift-Enter or Ctrl-Enter insert a paragraph 
	separator or line separator respectively.
	<br><i>Configuration:</i> In order to enable shift and control 
	with the Enter keys, xterm or rxvt must be configured as shown 
	in the example configuration file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> 
	in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.

<a name=utf8display></a>
<h3>	Unicode display</h3>
	In UTF-8 terminal mode, mined displays all Unicode characters 
	if they are contained in the font used by the terminal.
	Fonts usually have a substitute glyph to indicate characters 
	not contained in the font.
	Wide characters (double-width glyphs) are displayed in a 
	double-width character cell of the terminal.
	Combining characters are displayed either combined or 
	separated (see <a href=#combined>Combining characters</a> below).
<p>
	Illegal UTF-8 sequences are displayed with highlighted 
	background, using the following indications.
	Furthermore, control characters encoded as a UTF-8 sequence 
	and control characters in the "C1" range (values 0x80..0x9F) 
	will be displayed similar to normal control characters but 
	with coloured highlighting.
	<dl><dd><table name=illegalutf8indications border=0>

	preceded by a character to be used for Unicode character 
	indication in non-Unicode terminal mode.
	<br>(The default configuration value is "<code>¤ 46</code>").

<h3>	Combining and joining characters</h3>
	Mined supports handling of combining characters, 
	featuring optional separate display and partial editing, 
	as described above in section <a href=#combined> Combining 
	characters</a>.

<a name=joined></a>
<h4>Joining characters</h4>
	If mined assumes that the terminal applies LAM/ALEF ligature 
	joining (either configured with the <code class=option>+UU</code> 
	right-to-left display option or auto-detected; correct native 
	support is known of mlterm), the joined character width will 
	be handled correctly in cooperation with the terminal.
	In all other terminals mined will apply LAM/ALEF joining itself.
	<br>
	Mined supports ligature joining in both combining character 
	display modes:
	<ul>
	<li>In combined display mode, the screen position is accounted 
	properly.
	Also, when deleting a character, a joined ligature is deleted 
	together with the base character, just like combining characters.
	<li>In separated display mode, the joining part of the ligature 
	is indicated using the appropriate isolated form, highlighted with 
	Unicode special indication background colour (similar to the 
	handling of combining characters).
	</ul>

<h3>	Search expression limitations</h3>
	Unicode search ranges can not be very large as all 
	included characters are listed in an internal buffer which is 
	limited to ca. 1 KB.

<h3>	UTF-8 preservation and byte-transparent editing</h3>
	When splitting lines that are too long for internal handling, 
	consistency of UTF-8 sequences is preserved (they are not split); 
	combining characters may get split off their base characters, 
	however, they will join seemlessly as lines are joined again 
	(e.g. when saving the file).
	Note that isolated combining characters, e.g. at the beginning of 
	a line, are always displayed as if in separated display mode.

<a name=unicodeenv></a>
<h3>	Terminal environment</h3>
	Unicode text can be edited in any terminal encoding (UTF-8, 
	8 bit, CJK), however, a UTF-8 terminal is preferable.
	<dl>
	UTF-8 terminal operation can be configured in either of these ways:
	<ul>
	<li>Auto-detection: If the terminal emits cursor position reports, 
	mined can uniquely recognise UTF-8 terminal encoding and further 
	UTF-8 features 
	(see <a href=#terminalencoding>Terminal encoding support</a> below).
	<li>Environment: By proper environment variable settings. 
	For more details, see <a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a>.
	<br><i>Note:</i> In general, it is advisable to start a 
	terminal window using a wrapper script that sets a suitable 
	locale environment at the same time, in order to support all 
	kinds of applications that are more dependent on proper 
	environment setting than mined is.
	The mined installation also provides the script 
	<code>uterm</code> for this purpose, with its own manual page.
	(In case <code>uterm</code> is not installed, it is also 
	included in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.)
	<li>Parameter: <code class=option>+EU</code> selects UTF-8 terminal mode.
	</ul>

<h2>CJK support (Chinese/Japanese/Korean Han character features)</h2>
<dl><dd>
	Mined provides CJK support features uniformly in Unicode 
	and in major CJK encodings. For information relating to 
	CJK character encoding see <a href=#charencoding>
	Character encoding support</a> below.

<a name=cjkinputmethods></a>
<h3>	CJK input method support</h3>
	<i>Input methods</i> for CJK characters are supported with 
	the <a href=#keymap>keyboard mapping</a> feature.
	A number of popular input methods for CJK text input 
	are pre-configured, others can be added at compile-time 
	with the <a href=#mkkbmap><code>mkkbmap</code></a> script.

<a name=radicalstroke></a>
<h4>Radical/Stroke input method</h4>
	Mined provides a Radical/Stroke input method for CJK 
	characters with specific functionality in addition to keyboard 
	mapping; it works at two-levels, selecting a radical first, 
	then a character from a list sorted by stroke count.
	If this input method is active, a selection menu for the 214 
	CJK radicals is displayed (without prior keyboard input).
	The menu displays all variations of each radical. After 
	selecting a radical from this menu, a second-level menu 
	is displayed, showing all CJK characters based on the 
	selected radical, sorted by the number of strokes.
	Many of these menus will not fit on the screen and can be 
	scrolled.
	Pressing Escape here would return to the radical menu; 
	pressing Escape there would disable the input method.
	To enter a non-mapped character (e.g. a line end), you 
	need to disable Radical/Stroke input method temporarily; 
	just toggle it back on with Alt-k (or Esc k) or Ctrl-Alt-F12 and 
	the radical menu will be displayed again for continued input.

<h3>	Han character information display</h3>
	When the cursor is on a Han character and either descriptive 
	or pronunciation information about this character is available 
	in the Unihan database (from unicode.org), mined can 
	optionally display this information, with a selection of 
	display details which may include semantic information and 
	various pronunciations.
	<br>To enable Han info, select it in the Info menu.
	To open the Info menu, type Alt-F10 or right-click the 
	"<code class=flag>?</code>" flag.
	<img align=right src=haninfo-menu.png>
	<br clear=all>The information can optionally be shown on the status line 
	(where it may be truncated if too long) or in a pop-up menu next 
	to the character.
	<br>Pronunciation information to be displayed can be selected 
	in the Info menu.
	While selecting multiple pronunciation options, the menu stays open.

	<p>The same information is always shown while you are browsing 
	an input method pick list (then on the status line).
	<br clear=all>
	<p>Han character information display can be selected with the 
	<code class=option>+?h</code> command line parameter (or 
	<code class=option>+?x</code> for short display on the 
	status line).
	To preselect continuous Han character information display, 
	append this parameter to the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDOPT</span>.
	<p>
	The information includes the character code (in CJK encoding, 
	both CJK code and corresponding Unicode value are shown).
	The amount of descriptive information (from the Unihan 
	database) to be shown can also be preconfigured with the 
	environment variable <span class=env>MINEDHANINFO</span>; 
	see <a href=#haninfoconf>Han info configuration</a> below.
	<br>(For the Unicode version used for the Unihan data source, 
	see the Options - About information or the mined change log.)

<h2>Terminal encoding support</h2>
<dl><dd>
	Mined supports UTF-8 terminals, CJK terminals, Latin-1 and 
	other 8-bit encoded terminals.

<h3>	Terminal feature detection</h3>
	<dl>Mined performs auto-detection of a number of terminal 
	features:
	<ul>
	<li>For UTF-8 terminals, mined performs auto-detection of 
	terminal features (detection of UTF-8 terminal, different 
	width data and combining data versions, handling of 
	double-width, combining and joining characters).
	<li>For CJK terminals, mined performs some auto-detection of 
	specific CJK terminal features (handling of non-EUC code 
	points, handling of extended code range, GB18030, 3-byte and 
	4-byte encodings, detection of kterm JIS encoding, detection 
	of rxvt emulating CJK encoded terminal, special CJK width 
	properties, and terminal support of combining characters).
	<li>For mapped 8-bit terminals, mined performs auto-detection 
	of terminal support of combining characters.
	<li>For the Unicode version used for width and combining 
	character properties, see the Options - About information or the 
	mined change log.
	<li>CJK terminals cannot always be distinguished from 8-bit 
	terminals by auto-detection. Neither can the encoding of either 
	CJK or 8-bit terminals be auto-detected.
	It is thus advisable to setup proper settings of locale 
	environment variables (<span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, <span class=env>LANG</span>).
	Alternatively, the effective terminal encoding can be indicated 
	to mined with a command line option (<code class=option>+E</code>X).
	For configuration details, see 
	<a href=#localeconv>Locale configuration</a> below.
	</ul>
	</dl>

<h3>	Specific terminal properties</h3>
	For more specific configuration hints (especially for PC-based 
	terminals), see the <a href=#terminalenv>Terminal environment</a> 
	configuration hints below.

<h2>Mined Command reference (command and key function assignments)</h2>

<dl><dd>
	<i>General note on using keys with Control, Shift, Alt modifiers:</i>
	Mined makes use of many key combinations modified with 
	Control, Shift, Alt, or a combination of them, as a resource 
	for invoking a larger number of specific functions, providing 
	modified functionality as well as accented character input 
	support.
	Some of these key combinations may be limited by local 
	environment, especially the window system, or may need 
	extra configuration to be enabled.
	<br>Especially modified function keys are often intercepted by 
	window systems for special functions.
	<br>In general, mined interprets an ESC prefix as an alternative 
	for an Alt-key combination. For further advice and window system 
	specific hints on further remedies, as well as configuration hints, 
	to enable modified key input see the 
	<a href=#modifiedkeys>hint box under Accent prefix keys</a> above.

	"HOP right", i.e. by pressing the keypad keys "5 4" or "5 6" 
	in sequence.
	<dd>So there is enough room left for mapping the most frequent

		HTML numeric character entity (starting with "&#" 
		and optionally ending with ";"), it is replaced with 
		the respective character it denotes.

	<br>&amp;#64; &rarr; @
	<li>If the text at the cursor position contains a URL 
		numeric escape notation (starting with "%") it is 
		replaced with the actual character it represents.
	<br>Example: %40 &rarr; @
	<br>%C3%86 &rarr; Æ <i>(while in UTF-8 text encoding)</i>
	<li>The command also transforms between Latin-1 and UTF-8 
		encoded characters if an accordingly encoded character 
		is found at the current position; the current

<h2>Configuration of user preferences</h2>
<dl><dd>
	User preferences can be configured in a runtime configuration file 
	<code class=path>$HOME/.minedrc</code>. (On Windows systems, 
	if the environment variable <code class=env>%HOME%</code> is not set, 
	<code class=path>%USERPROFILE%\.minedrc</code> will be used.)
	It is possible to configure conditional preferences based on 
	file type (filename pattern) or terminal type.
	<br>A documented sample file is included in the Mined runtime 
	support library as <code class=path>conf_user/minedrc</code> 
	or in the <a href=configuration.html>web documentation</a>.
	<br><i>Volatile preferences when editing multiple files</i>:
	<br>Note that options relating to editing features (such as tabwidth) 
	will be re-established on each file opened,
	while options relating to interactive behaviour or display features 
	(such as file_chooser sorting options) will remain changed after they 
	are toggled interactively (e.g. from the Options menu),
	so the preference selected here is volatile for them.

</dl>
<h2>Environment interworking and configuration hints</h2>
<dl><dd>
	A number of configuration options have already been addressed 
	throughout the manual page. A few more configuration features 
	are mentioned here. For more details, examples, and other 
	display settings see the example script 
	<code class=path>conf_user/profile.mined</code> in the Mined runtime 
	support library.

<h3>	PC versions</h3>
	For Windows with a cygwin system 
	(<a target=_blank href=http://cygwin.com/>http://cygwin.com/</a>), 
	mined is available as a cygwin package.
	<br>Two other versions are available for DOS/Windows systems:
	<ul>
	<li>Stand-alone Windows version, compiled with cygwin. It runs 
	in a Windows console, Windows terminal (e.g. mintty), or X terminal.
	It is packaged together with mintty.
	Its installation registers its invocation (in mintty) from the 
	Windows context menu for text files.
	<li>DOS version, compiled with djgpp. It runs on plain DOS (with 
	some special support of FreeDOS codepage configuration) or in a 
	Windows console window (DOS command window) but not in a 
	typical terminal application like mintty or xterm.
	It supports long file names in Windows 98/2000/XP/... (not NT4.0).
	</ul>
	See the mined web site 
	<a target=_top href=https://mined.github.io>https://mined.github.io</a> 
	for download.
	<p>For hints on PC-specific terminal configuration issues, 
	see <a href=#pcterminals>PC terminals</a> below.

<p><hr width=95%>
<h3>	VMS version</h3>
	Mined runs on OpenVMS, with a number of specific adaptations 
	especially in file handling.
	<ul>
	<li>Options containing capital letters need to be quoted, e.g.
	<code>MINED "-Qa" [-]*.com</code>.
	Mined options can also be passed in the symbol <span class=env>MINED$OPT</span>.
	<li>Filename wildcard expansion is applied, accepting both Unix-like 
	and VMS-native subdirectory notations.
	<li>File versions can optionally be specified and are handled 
	properly; for example, an explicit version opened for editing 
	can be saved and will be the most recent version as expected.
	<br><i>Note:</i> To combine wildcards with version specifications, 
	use VMS-native pathname notation 
	(and do not use a final ";" without version specification), e.g.:
	<dl>
	<dd><code class=path>[]x*;*</code>
		to edit all versions of all files x*
	<dd><code class=path>[.cmd]x*;1</code>
		to edit version 1 of all files cmd/x*
	</dl>
	<li>The file chooser accepts Unix-like or VMS-style directory 
	notations for navigation.
	Switching to the current directory (TAB or Enter) which is the 
	first entry of the file chooser list, displayed in VMS style, 
	turns the file list into VMS-style listing of all file versions.
	<br>Logical names can be used for direct navigation if a final 
	":" is included (like <code>SYS$LOGIN:</code>).
	<li>Note that opening the file chooser may be slow on 
	large directories.
	<li>If the terminal window is resized while mined is running, mined 
	will notice and adjust after an explicit refresh (ESC .). The 
	system, however, is not notified of the changed window size in 
	this case. Please resize (again) when back on the command line.
	<li>The capability to accept terminal copy-paste is limited by the 
	VMS 80 character input buffer (not limited on emulated VMS, e.g. 
	on "Personal Alpha"). For some remote terminals (mintty, rxvt), 
	full Unicode data version detection is disabled to reduce 
	start-up delay.
	<li>The file info memory files are called .$mined instead of .@mined,
	recovery files are called $name$ instead of #name#.
	<li>In the VAX version, CJK character encodings, Han character 
	information, and Unicode character information tables are not 
	included by default. Alpha and IA64 versions include all 
	Unicode and character encoding features.
	<li>For hints related to the <a href=#decterm>DECterm</a> window, see below.
	</ul>
	See the template script <code class=path>MINED-VMS.COM</code> in the 
	<code class=path>conf_user</code> subdirectory of the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> or the file 
	<code class=path>README.vms</code> 
	(<code class=path>MINED.README</code> in the VMS binary package) 
	for installation hints.

<p><hr width=95%>
<h3>	Android version</h3>
	There are a number of deviations from typical Linux systems;
	mined provides workarounds where necessary.
	Mined runs on Android with these Apps installed:
	<ul>
	<li>C4droid (needed as container for gcc)
	<li>GCC for C4droid (to compile mined)
	<li>Better Terminal (recommended, for shell and terminal)
	<li>UniversalAndroot (to access gcc from terminal shell) for Android &lt; 4
	</ul>

<p><hr width=95%>
<h3>	Terminal environment</h3>
	<dd><i>For terminal-specific hints, see 
	<a href=#terminalinterworking>Terminal interworking problems</a> below</i>
	<p>On Unix, the terminal type is determined from the environment 
	variable <span class=env>TERM</span>. The termcap/terminfo mechanism 
	is used to derive the actual properties of the terminal; for 
	some terminals (cygwin, xterm, rxvt, vt*), this information is 
	also built-in as a fallback in case terminal information is 
	not available on a system (this is especially useful for the 
	cygwin stand-alone version).
	<p>
	Recognition of some special terminal features or restrictions 
	is associated with the setting of <span class=env>TERM</span> 
	(xterm, linux, vt100, sun*, cygwin, rxvt, *ansi*, 9780*, hp*, 
	xterm-hp, superbee*, sb*, microb*, scoansi*, xterm-sco, cons*, 
	att605-pc, ti_ansi, mgterm).
	Non-trivial screen features (like scroll reverse, add/delete line, 
	erase multiple characters) are used if their support is indicated 
	in the termcap/terminfo description of the terminal unless other 
	information is available (e.g. after terminal version detection, 
	an older xterm is supposed not to support erase characters).
	Since colour support is often not configured within terminfo but 
	modern terminals do support it, mined always tries to apply 
	colour attributes (if the terminal at least supports ANSI 
	control sequences). A number of other "best practice" approaches 
	are taken to optimize the usage of terminal capabilities, esp. 
	covering different methods of graphics display support (for 
	menu borders).
	<p>
	For detection of function keys and cursor keys, 
	the escape sequences being used by terminals are often 
	not known to an operating system environment because they 
	are poorly and incompletely configured. Because this does 
	usually not work as expected (see this
	<a target=_blank href=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16>
	bug report</a> just for an example), mined does not rely on 
	the termcap/terminfo configuration of function key codes alone 
	(which it considers however since mined 2000.14); 
	rather it always accepts a wide variety of typical codes.
	A few ambiguous codes are resolved according to the 
	<span class=env>TERM</span> variable.
	<p>
	In an xterm, window headline and icon text are set to the 
	current filename and "(*)" is added if the text has been 
	modified.

<a name=localeconv></a>
<h4>Locale configuration</h4>
	The locale mechanism as implemented on modern systems has a 
	number of design problems, one being that there is 
	no explicit distinction between text encoding and terminal 
	encoding although this is obviously a very different thing and 
	mixed combinations of both may occur and are actually supported 
	by mined.
	<br>
	For this reason, mined extends the locale environment variable 
	mechanism with the variable <span class=env>TEXTLANG</span> which is 
	only considered for assumed text encoding (with precedence 
	over the standard locale variables), and also considers 
	<span class=env>LANGUAGE</span> with precedence.
	<br>
	If one of these additional locale variables 
	(<span class=env>LANGUAGE</span> or <span class=env>TEXTLANG</span>) is used, 
	mined also implicitly enables smart quotes.
	<br>
	Also mined provides command line parameters to explicit override 
	either text or terminal encoding (UTF-8 terminal encoding, however, 
	is always auto-detected if the terminal provides the information).

	<ul>
	<li>For <i>text encoding</i>, mined checks the variables 
	<span class=env>LANGUAGE</span>, 
	<span class=env>TEXTLANG</span>, <span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, 
	<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, <span class=env>LANG</span> in this order.
	<li>For <i>terminal encoding</i>, mined checks the variables 
	<span class=env>LC_ALL</span>, <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, <span class=env>LANG</span> in this order.
	<li>Explicit command line parameters are available to specify 
	either terminal encoding (<code class=option>+E</code>) 
	or text encoding (<code class=option>-E</code>). They override 
	environment variable settings.
	<li>UTF-8 terminal auto-detection overrides other terminal 
	encoding settings.
	<li>Text encoding auto-detection overrides environment 
	settings but not command line settings.
	<li>Assumed text encoding can be switched while editing.
	</ul>

	<p>For encoding recognition from locale environment variables, 
	mined recognises locale specifications typically found in 
	system installations, including those which do not include an 
	explicit encoding suffix. Known character encoding suffixes 
	("codeset" component of locale name, starting with ".") are 
	recognised regardless of whether the given locale is installed 
	or not. Other encodings are recognised by region suffix 
	(starting with "_") or full locale name or alias.
	<br>
	In addition to hard-coded locale recognition (especially for CJK), 
	locale values and associated encodings are configured in the 
	compile-time configuration file <code class=path>locales.cfg</code> 
	which especially lists locale names that do not have an 
	explicit encoding suffix.
	You can use these settings (known locale name or generic 
	locale name suffix) even on legacy systems without locale 
	support to indicate the terminal environment properly to mined.

	<dl>
	For encoding recognition from command-line parameters, 
	mined provides the following options:
	<ul>
	<li><code class=option>-E</code>X <i>or</i> <code class=option>+E</code>X
	with a single-letter encoding tag as listed with the description 
	of the 
	<a href=#encodingoption><code class=option>-E</code> options</a>;
	further encoding tags are configured in the compile-time 
	configuration file <code class=path>charmaps.cfg</code>.
	</li>
	<li><code class=option>-E=</code>charmap <i>or</i> <code class=option>+E=</code>charmap
	with a character encoding name (as reported by the 
	<code>locale charmap</code> command).
	</li>
	<li><code class=option>-E.</code>suffix <i>or</i> <code class=option>+E.</code>suffix
	with a character encoding suffix ("codeset" of locale name).
	</li>
	<li><code class=option>-E:</code>flag <i>or</i> <code class=option>+E:</code>flag
	with a 2-letter indication used by mined to indicate the 
	respective text encoding in the Encoding flag.
	</li>
	<li><code class=option>-E-</code> or <code class=option>-E</code>
	disables text encoding auto-detection which is then 
	derived from the locale environment.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<dt>
	In these options, <code class=option>-E</code> specifies 
	text encoding while <code class=option>+E</code> would specify 
	terminal encoding to be assumed.
	</dl>

	<p>The following table lists encodings and major codepages 
	that are recognised by a generic locale suffix or country code;
	in addition (as mentioned above), a large number of locale names 
	without encoding suffix as found on various systems is known to mined 
	and will cause it to assume the corresponding terminal encoding.

	<p><i>Examples:</i> To indicate that mined is running in a

	<dt><dd><code>mined +EU -E:GB</code>
	</dl>

<a name=utf16></a>
	<p><i>Selecting UTF-16 text mode:</i> To tell mined to 
	interpret a file (or make a new file) in UTF-16 encoding, use 
	the following command line options (first two little endian, 
	then big endian):
	<dl>
	<dt><dd><code>mined -E:61</code>
	<dt><dd><code>mined -E=UTF-16LE</code>
	<dt><dd><code>mined -E:16</code>
	<dt><dd><code>mined -E=UTF-16BE</code>
	<dt><dd><code>mined -E=UTF-16</code>
	</dl>

	<p><i>Selecting ASCII terminal mode:</i> To tell mined to 
	assume that a terminal cannot display anything but ASCII 
	characters, use the command line option 
	<code class=option>+E:AS</code>.
	Mined implicitly assumes this setting if the environment 
	variable <span class=env>TERM</span> indicates a VT52 terminal.

<a name=pcterminals></a>
<h4>PC terminals</h4>
	Character encoding of PC terminals is an even greater mess 
	than on Unix systems. Mined provides heuristic best-guess 
	assumptions about terminal encoding, supporting both local 
	invocation as well as remote login from a PC (e.g. to a Unix 
	machine).

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	It is not unlikely that the assumption about the terminal 
	encoding taken by mined does not match the actual terminal 
	encoding (e.g. mined cannot determine the encoding based on 
	the ambiguous setting <span class=env>TERM</span>=ansi). Environment variables that 
	indicate the character encoding are unfortunately not maintained 
	through telnet or remote login.
	<br>Explicitly setting <span class=env>TERM</span> to a suitable value after remote login 
	may help but may not always work (e.g. pcansi is not a 
	known terminal on SunOS).
	Explicitly setting locale variables, e.g. <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>, 
	may indicate the encoding to mined but may cause trouble otherwise; 
	some systems like SunOS are dogmatic about interpreting locale 
	variables and strictly ask corresponding locale data to be installed 
	or they will flood you with bogus error messages.
	Also not all encodings, esp. PC "codepages", are known as a 
	"locale charmap" on other systems.
	<br>In these cases, you can use the explicit <code class=option>+E</code> 
	option to force mined to assume a specific terminal encoding; 
	see the option values listed above for the main DOS encodings.

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	The encoding emulated by cygwin (as configured, or by default 
	typically CP1252 for cygwin 1.5, UTF-8 for cygwin 1.7) is not the 
	encoding natively applied by the Windows console window (by 
	default typically the DOS codepage CP850).
	This means that the effective encoding may be different if you 
	invoke the cygwin-compiled mined version and the 
	djgpp-compiled mined version alternatingly; you may notice this 
	by a different range of characters that can be displayed when 
	opening the same file with the two mined versions.
	<br>Some Windows Latin characters are poorly displayed by the 
	Windows console in default configuration; cygwin 1.7 can 
	display all characters properly if the Windows console font is 
	configured to "Lucida Console" rather than "Raster Fonts".
	<br>In a cygwin console on a non-cygwin system (after remote login), 
	mined assumes ASCII as the terminal encoding by default unless 
	properly indicated by environment variables.

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	The following DOS codepages are supported; they are mainly provided 
	as terminal codepages, they do not appear in the Encoding menu. 
	However, if you need, you can ask mined to use them as either 
	the assumed terminal encoding (e.g. +E=CP1250 or +E:WE) or 
	even text encoding (e.g. -E=CP1250 or -E:WE) using the names 
	or shortcuts from the list:

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	For the djgpp version of mined, even the font chosen for the 
	Windows console window may affect the effective display encoding.
	Configure "Raster Fonts" (except of size "10 x 20"!), not 
	"Lucida Console" in order to make sure the effective visual 
	codepage is the same as the one selected with the respective 
	DOS tools (e.g. chcp) and assumed by mined.

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	Mined (djgpp) tries to determine the DOS/Windows codepage 
	using the DOS API; this can only work if the codepage was 
	properly configured with DOS means (e.g. with CP858 using 
	<code>CHCP 858</code> or <code>MODE CON CP SELECT=858</code>, 
	maybe enabled by <code>DEVICE=...\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,858)</code> 
	on old DOS, or <code>MODE CON CP PREP=((codepage list) ...\ega.cpi)</code>); 
	if only the font is switched to a differently encoded one, 
	there is no way to detect this - in this case you can still 
	use environment setting or the <code class=option>+E</code> 
	option as described above to indicate the terminal encoding.

	<p><i>Note:</i> To enable mouse operation in a Windows console 
	window, deactivate "QuickEdit mode" in the properties menu.

	<p><i>Note:</i> If the DOS screen size is changed by a TSR 
	(e.g. VGAMAX using a hotkey), mined does not notice this 
	immediately; in that case, mined adjusts its screen display 
	only after the next key is typed.

	<p><i>Note:</i>
	Running mined (djgpp) in a dosemu session (DOS emulator on Linux) 
	works fine, even in an xterm-embedded session although not 
	perfectly in that case: ^S and ^Q are interpreted for flow 
	control (thus ^S will hold all output until ^Q is entered), 
	and the mined option <code class=option>-Qa</code> should be 
	used to tune menu borders right.

<a name=terminalsetup></a>
<h4>Terminal setup and configuration</h4>
	The <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	includes a number of configuration files providing settings that 
	should be applied to various terminals for proper operation of 
	several features as described throughout this manual:
	<ul>
	<li><code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> for major X Windows terminals: 
	xterm, rxvt, some CJK xterm derivates (cxterm, kterm). The script
	<code class=cmd>xinitrc.mined</code> (and optionally <code class=cmd>kp5</code>) 
	can be used to establish the suggested settings.
	<li><code class=path>konsole/xterm-modified.keytab</code> for 
	KDE konsole keyboard definitions
	<li><code class=path>mlterm/key</code> and <code class=path>mlterm/main</code> 
	for mlterm keyboard definitions
	<li><code class=path>terminator/options</code> for terminator keyboard definitions
	</ul>
	<p>
	In some terminals, the cursor may not be well visible or not 
	visible at all if the cursor is on a character 
	with reverse background (control character, occurs e.g. in xterm) 
	or highlighted background (invalid character code, occurs e.g. 
	in xterm and rxvt).
	See the X resource parameters for "cursorColor" in the example 
	configuration file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> for remedy.
	<p>
	If mouse wheel movement moves more than expected, especially 
	if it cannot move by single items in a menu, this is probably 
	a configuration issue with your mouse driver.
	You are probably running a Windows-based X server which is 
	(often by default) configured to generate multiple mouse 
	wheel events on each actual mouse wheel movement.
	Often not even in the Control Panel mouse section, but only 
	in a configuration menu of mouse-specific setup software 
	(e.g. "Browser Mouse Settings"), configure the scroll unit to 1.

<a name=terminalinterworking></a>
<h4>Terminal interworking problems</h4>
	With some terminals, problems are known due to missing terminal 
	features or terminal bugs:

	<p><b>any terminal: menu border display</b>
	<li>If the borders of mined menus appear as letters rather 
	than graphic borders, the terminal can unexpectedly not handle 
	VT100 graphics.
	Use the option <code class=option>-Qa</code> to switch to ASCII 
	borders, or <code class=option>-fff</code> to limit font assumptions.
	<br>In a UTF-8 terminal, mined uses Unicode Box Drawing 
	characters by default.
	If they don't display they are missing in the font used by the 
	terminal.
	Use the option <code class=option>-Qv</code> to switch to 
	VT100 graphics or <code class=option>-Qa</code> to switch to 
	ASCII graphics. If borders are visible but without corners, use 
	<code class=option>-Qs</code> to switch to simple rectangular borders.

	<p><b>any terminal: slow terminal feature auto-detection</b>
	<li>On a slow remote terminal connection, escape sequences from the 
	terminal (sent for function keys or requested terminal responses) 
	may get delayed and split up.
	Mined tries to handle delayed parts of escape sequences graciously; 
	however, this is limited as the explicit ESC key shall also be 
	recognised.
	<br>If messages like "Late screen mode response &ndash; ..." 
	(after startup), "...awaiting slow terminal response" (esp. 
	after startup), "...awaiting slow key code sequence" or 
	"...absorbing delayed terminal..." occur, escape sequence detection 
	may be adjusted by setting the environment variable
	<span class=env>ESCDELAY</span> to a value of 2000 or 3000.
	(Delay during startup may apparently also be caused by 
	on-demand font loading of rxvt or mlterm, however, mined applies 
	special handling for this case.)
	<li>If proper terminal detection fails for delay reasons, mined 
	may especially not be aware of the terminal encoding (and 
	display line markers as blocks). In this case, 
	exiting and restarting mined should resolve the issue.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>xterm</b>
	<li>To enable proper Alt-letter command input (for opening and 
	navigating menus), set the xterm resource metaSendsEscape to true 
	(or with older versions of xterm, set eightBitInput to false) 
	in your X configuration (usually <code class=path>$HOME/.Xdefaults</code> 
	or <code class=path>$HOME/.Xresources</code>) as suggested in 
	the example file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in 
	the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<li>Although it is a waste of keyboard resources to have two 
	indistinguishable sets of keypad keys, most terminals provide 
	no means of distinguish them towards the applications, at least 
	not by default. Especially for a text editor, it is highly 
	desirable to distinguish them in order to have a rich intuitive 
	function key mapping at disposition which mined tries to achieve.
	<br>One approach to improve mapping of useful key functions 
	would be actual keyboard remapping (applicable on some terminals); 
	this is a delicate approach, though, because it may create 
	incompatibilities with other programs that rely strictly on 
	installed terminfo information. Mined provides remapping 
	recommendations for shifted keypad keys (with Shift, Control, 
	Alt and combinations of them) in the configuration sample files 
	<code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> (for xterm), 
	<code class=path>konsole/xterm-modified.keytab</code> (for KDE konsole), 
	<code class=path>mlterm/key</code> (for mlterm), 
	in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<br>Due to the compatibility limitations mentioned above, however, 
	the two Ins keys remain indistinguishable, and the two Del keys 
	are only distinguishable if the xterm configuration resource 
	*VT100*deleteIsDEL is set. Also, keypad and function key 
	modification with Alt is ensured with the xterm resource 
	*VT100*metaSendsEscape. Both resources are set to true in the 
	configuration sample file just mentioned.
	<br>These two resources can also be set dynamically with xterm. 
	Mined can be told to do so with the command line option 
	<code class=option>+D</code>.
	(Unfortunately this handling cannot be enabled by default as 
	it cannot be undone because the previous state cannot be 
	detected.)
	<li>Mined determines the xterm version in order to apply 
	certain workarounds conditionally.
	<li>If you run xterm in VT220 keyboard mode (using xterm option 
	-kt vt220 or setting the configuration resource *keyboardType: 
	vt220) you should make sure to also set the environment 
	variable <span class=env>TERM</span>=vt220 (e.g. using the xterm option -tn vt220 or 
	setting the configuration resource *termName: vt220) so mined 
	can properly set up the keypad functions.
	<li>If you run xterm with the resource modifyCursorKeys or 
	modifyFunctionKeys set to value 1, mined will recognise the 
	according keyboard sequences with the environment variable 
	setting <span class=env>TERM</span>=xterm-sco.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>xterm on cygwin</b>
	<li>On cygwin, as on other systems, the script <code>uterm</code> 
	is recommended to invoke an xterm that is properly configured 
	to run UTF-8, and also to use a best choice of fonts for optimal 
	Unicode coverage. See README.cygwin for more detailed advice.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>xterm legacy CJK width mode</b>
	<li>Mined auto-detects and supports xterm legacy CJK width 
	compatibility mode (<code>xterm -cjk_width</code>); character 
	width and menu border layout are properly adjusted, stylish 
	menu borders (<code class=option>-QQ</code>) and fine-grained 
	scroll bar display are disabled by default.
	(Note: In this mode, combining characters could unexpectedly 
	change the width of a character by being substituted with its 
	wide precomposed form (e.g. 'a' combined with U+0300) - 
	which an application can hardly handle; this bug was fixed in 
	xterm 224 with a patch contributed by the mined author.)

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>rxvt</b>
	<li>When starting mined in a fresh rxvt terminal, and maybe 
	even after starting your X server, some display (font?) 
	initialization may take extremely long. If this results in an 
	error message, restart mined to ensure proper terminal 
	properties auto-detection.
	<li>Rxvt does not distinguish between Shift-F1 and F11 / 
	Shift-F2 and F12 / Ctrl-Shift-F1 and Ctrl-F11 / Ctrl-Shift-F2 
	and Ctrl-F12, so that the F1 and F2 keys modified with Shift 
	cannot be recognised in rxvt by default.
	They can however be enabled with the keysym definitions in 
	the file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<li>In rxvt, the two keypad Del keys (small keypad, numeric 
	keypad) are automatically distinguished from each other and 
	invoke the Delete character (small keypad) and Cut (numeric 
	keypad) functions, respectively (Ctrl-/Shift-/Alt- 
	alternatives are supported as described in this manual).
	This works, however, only if mined can recognise rxvt; it is 
	generally a bad idea to set <span class=env>TERM</span>=xterm in rxvt, see also 
	<a href=#termrxvt>hint below</a>.
	<li>Also in rxvt, the two keypad Ins keys (small keypad left, 
	numeric keypad right) are distinguished. The left Ins key 
	positions the cursor left of the pasted region, the right Ins 
	key positions it right.
	<li>By setting rxvt in the mode that enables distinction between 
	the two keypads, it can unfortunately not distinguish the 
	right keypad modified with Ctrl- anymore, so Ctrl-Home/End/Del 
	cannot work as desired.
	<li>Ctrl-modified punctuation keys can be enabled by 
	following the configuration samples of the file 
	<code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the <a href=#support>Mined 
	runtime support library</a>.
	<br>Note: Ctrl-modified and shifted punctuation keys 
	interfere with ISO 14755 input mode of rxvt; if the following 
	key is entered twice, that mode is aborted and the modified 
	punctuation key becomes effective as an accent prefix in mined.
	<li>To enable proper Alt-letter command input (for opening and 
	navigating menus), set the rxvt resource meta8 to false in your 
	X configuration (usually <code class=path>$HOME/.Xdefaults</code> 
	or <code class=path>$HOME/.Xresources</code>) as suggested in 
	the example file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in 
	the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<li>Later rxvt-unicode provides a CJK terminal emulation.
	CJK display is buggy for characters that rxvt thinks cannot be 
	displayed, especially for GB18030 
	(<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>=zh_CN.gb18030 rxvt) but also 
	e.g. for EUC-JP (<span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>=ja_JP.eucjp rxvt);
	single bytes are then interpreted instead which amounts to an 
	unpredictable screen width and cannot be correctly handled.
	(This applies mainly to character codes that are not mapped to 
	Unicode but also to many that are mapped.)
	<br>Moreover, CJK width handling is inconsistent for many 
	characters in rxvt CJK mode (rxvt claims to adhere to the 
	locale mechanism in this respect but that's not the case here &ndash; 
	character widths are inconsistent with the locale, too).
	<br><i>Remedy:</i> Don't use rxvt in CJK-encoded mode; mined 
	CJK terminal support is tailored to native CJK terminals (such 
	as cxterm, kterm, hanterm) where it works fine &ndash; if you use a 
	UTF-8-capable terminal, use it in UTF-8 mode! Mined can edit 
	CJK-encoded files well in a UTF-8-encoded terminal.
	<li>In rxvt, Unicode characters that are Not Assigned are 
	always displayed as a single-width replacement character. This 
	is not consistent with xterm behaviour which would display 
	them as a double-width replacement if they are located within 
	a double-width Unicode range (which sounds reasonable). This 
	would cause display positioning inconsistencies. Mined has a 
	workaround for some of these cases (assuming that rxvt runs 
	the most recent Unicode width data version available; or 
	actually the same as mined assumes &ndash; handling of multiple 
	auto-detected terminal Unicode versions does not cover this 
	special case).
	<li>If the X windows servers has duplicate fonts installed under 
	a common name (e.g. if it comes with a 10x20 non-Unicode font and 
	you install a 10x20 Unicode font in addition), rxvt seems to use 
	the wrong (i.e., non-Unicode) version of the font and does not 
	find special characters like the default marker used in the flags 
	menus (this was observed since rxvt 7.5, rxvt 5.8 was finding the 
	proper font). Use the mined option <code class=option>-F</code> to 
	adapt mined to limited font usage, or fix the X server installation.
	Or use the script <code>uterm</code> to start rxvt-unicode. To 
	start rxvt-unicode from an xterm, use <code>uterm -rx</code>.
	<li>Due to the scrollbar display workaround for hanterm (see 
	above), the scrollbar position may be shown as blank space 
	instead of coloured (only in rxvt CJK mode with Korean encoding 
	and if you explicitly set <span class=env>TERM</span>=xterm which you shouldn't 
	anyway in rxvt).
	In this case, coloured scrollbar foreground can be enabled 
	with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span>="44;36" or 
	<span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span>="38;5;45".
	<li>As a workaround for an xterm bug on cygwin, mined applies 
	terminal size re-adjustment. This may confuse rxvt (being 
	resized to an unexpectedly large window) if it pretends to be xterm.
	<a name=termrxvt></a>
	<br><i>Remedy:</i> in rxvt, make sure that the environment 
	variable <span class=env>TERM</span>=rxvt (or rxvt-unicode); the according X resource 
	(Rxvt.termName: rxvt) is also listed in the file 
	<code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a>.
	<li>Mined determines the rxvt version in order to use certain 
	features conditionally.
	<li>CJK-mode rxvt: rxvt has some character width bugs when running 
	in CJK encoding; e.g. when running rxvt in Big5 terminal encoding 
	(locale zh_TW), U+FA18 is displayed with wrong screen width 
	while in older version U+FFED was display with wrong screen width;
	when running rxvt in Shift_JIS terminal encoding, a number of 
	character width bugs occur. Mined does not implement workarounds 
	for those; in general UTF-8 terminal encoding is advisable to be 
	on the safe side.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>urxvt</b>
	<li>This is rxvt-unicode as packaged for cygwin. Invoke it with 
	a proper locale environment variable set to enable UTF-8.
	See also README.cygwin for more detailed hints.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>mlterm</b>
	<li>Bidirectional display handling of mlterm is based on the 
	final display, not regarding any context (such as positioning 
	control, that's why mined implements a workaround for menu 
	display on mlterm). Since version 3.0.7, mlterm supports 
	logical order mouse positioning over right-to-left lines.
	<li>For Shift selection, use the small keypad.
	<li>Recent mlterm before version 3.1.3 has a problem with 
	colour control that may render text unreadable.
	<li>In recent mlterm versions, Control-function keys cannot 
	be used in mined since they are captured as mlterm hotkeys.
	Use a Control-V prefix as a workaround.
	<li>(Not essential anymore with recent mlterm versions) 
	The <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	includes a configuration file <code class=path>mlterm/key</code> which 
	defines enhanced escape sequences for function keys and 
	other modified keys in order to enable the functionality 
	described in this manual. (It also enables the keypad on systems 
	lacking its configuration for mlterm.)
	It is essential to use this configuration especially for the 
	HOP key (keypad "5") which is oppressed by mlterm by default, 
	and also for Control-punctuation accent prefix functions, and 
	some others.
	<li>In old versions of mlterm, mouse wheel scroll navigation 
	in menus did not work seamlessly due to incorrect escape sequences.
	<li>Do not use mlterm option -n ! It may produce display garbage 
	on unknown and other characters.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>cxterm</b>
	<li>Proper configuration is needed to ensure cxterm uses a 
	non-CJK font of appropriate size to avoid ragged display: parameter 
	<code>-fn "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"</code> 
	or X resource 
	<code>cxterm*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</code>.
	<li>EUC-JP half-width characters (8EA1-8EDF) are not properly 
	displayed by cxterm in EUC-JP mode (cxterm -JIS, not available 
	in "classic" cxterm).
	<li>Due to the scrollbar display workaround for hanterm (see 
	above), the scrollbar position may be shown as blank space 
	instead of coloured (only in Korean encoding mode which is 
	probably rarely used with cxterm anyway).
	In this case, coloured scrollbar foreground can be enabled 
	with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span>="44;36" or 
	<span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span>="38;5;45".
	<li><i>Note:</i> The configuration sample file 
	<code class=path>Xefaults.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> includes a 
	section to fix some missing keypad assignments, especially the 
	HOP key (keypad "5") which is ignored by cxterm by default, 
	and the Home and End keys of the numeric keypad.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>kterm</b>
	<li>Auto-detection of kterm as a CJK terminal works if the 
	environment variable <span class=env>TERM</span> indicates "kterm"; otherwise mined 
	has to be told that it runs in a CJK terminal and which 
	encoding to use:
	<br>
	For kterm -km sjis, set <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>=ja_JP.sjis (or invoke mined +ES).
	<br>
	For kterm -km euc, set <span class=env>LC_CTYPE</span>=ja_JP.eucjp (or invoke mined +EJ).
	<li><i>Note:</i>The configuration sample file 
	<code class=path>Xefaults.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> includes a 
	section to fix some missing keypad assignments, especially the 
	HOP key (keypad "5") which is ignored by kterm by default, and 
	the Home and End keys of both keypads.
	<li><b><i>Note:</i></b> Mouse wheel scroll navigation in menus 
	does not work seamlessly in kterm because kterm sends incorrect 
	escape sequences on mouse wheel scrolling.
	<li><b><i>Note:</i></b> By default (i.e., without explicit -km 
	option or corresponding *vt100.kanjiMode resource configured), 
	kterm runs in ISO 2022 mode (yes, it does indeed) which is not 
	supported by mined.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>hanterm</b>
	<li>CJK display is buggy at the line beginning or after a Tab, 
	often only the second byte of the character code is displayed 
	as an ASCII character instead of displaying the complete CJK 
	character.
	<li>Character attributes in hanterm used to be all mapped to reverse, 
	so there was a workaround to enable a visible position in the 
	scrollbar which is displayed as blank space. The criteria for 
	this workaround to apply are: CJK terminal (detected or 
	configured), <span class=env>TERM</span>=xterm, Korean encoding (UHC or Johab) 
	configured with parameter or locale. Replaced to enable nicer 
	colours in scrollbar. To reactivate workaround for older hanterm, 
	set environment variable <span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span>="0".

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>KDE konsole</b>
	<li>Due to the lack of decent Unicode font support in the default 
	configuration of the KDE konsole terminal, menu appearance 
	options <code class=option>-QQ</code> and 
	<code class=option>-Qr</code> should not be used; rounded 
	borders are disabled by default.
	<li>The <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	includes a configuration file <code class=path>konsole/xterm-modified.keytab</code> 
	which defines enhanced escape sequences for function keys and 
	other modified keys in order to enable the functionality 
	described in this manual. Unfortunately, the qt framework 
	used by konsole inhibits the use of some keys and many key 
	combinations.
	<li>It is especially irritating that konsole disregards 
	the middle keypad key ("5" in application mode) completely; 
	so the mined HOP function has to be invoked by alternative means.
	<br>As a remedy, the HOP function is also assigned to the 
	"Menu" key (next to the "Windows" key on PC keyboards) by the 
	configuration sample file <code class=path>konsole/xterm-modified.keytab</code>;
	follow the installation instruction in that file and select the 
	keyboard type it defines ("xterm with key modifiers") in konsole, 
	"Settings" - "Keyboard" menu.
	<br>Another remedy is to reassign the middle keypad key to the 
	X key symbol Menu (using <code>xmodmap</code>);
	the script <code>kp5</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> does this.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>gnome-terminal</b>
	<li>The gnome-terminal uses right mouse click for its own 
	terminal menu. To open a mined menu, use Ctrl-right-mouse-click.
	<li>The gnome-terminal does not support modified keys (e.g. 
	shifted keypad keys).
	<li>The gnome-terminal captures a number of Alt-letter key 
	combinations for its own menu access (which can however also 
	be controlled with the mouse).
	To disable this unpleasant capturing, so e.g. mined can open 
	its own menus with Alt-letter, configure gnome-terminal as follows:
	<br>Open menu "Edit" - "Keyboard Shortcuts..." and 
	check "Disable all menu access keys". Even then, however, F1 and 
	Ctrl-F1 are suppressed by this quirky terminal.
	<li>Mined implicitly assumes its <code class=option>-f</code> 
	option (for limited font usage with respect to graphic 
	characters) when detecting gnome-terminal.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Mac OS X Terminal and others</b>
	<li>The Mac OS X Terminal app does not support mouse escape sequences.
	Preferably, use xterm or <a target=_blank href=http://iterm2.com/>iTerm 2</a>.
	<li>In iTerm 2, enable mouse reporting in the settings menu 
	Preferences - Profile - Terminal.
	<li>If any Mac terminal (Terminal, xterm, iTerm 2) does not respond 
	to the ESC key, it is likely to be captured by Speech Recognition.
	Disable Speech Recognition or try Ctrl-ESC.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Linux console</b>
	<li>Mined detects F11, F12, Shift-F1...Shift-F8 properly
	(handling the shift of 2 applied by the Linux console to 
	shifted function key codes compared with other terminals);
	further modified function keys are apparently not supported in 
	the Linux console.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>screen</b>
	<dt>Screen, like luit (see below), is a middle layer between the 
	actual terminal and the user terminal environment.
	<br>Running screen in a cygwin console produces initial garbage 
	input in mined.
	<br>[Applies to older screen before version 4: Unfortunately, 
	screen does not pass character width handling of its host 
	terminal transparently to the application but apparently it 
	maintains cursor position information with reference to the 
	system-installed locale data. Which, however, does not always 
	reflect the terminal properties!
	Yet mined detects the proper width properties of the host terminal 
	(by using pass-through escape sequences of "screen") but 
	only if the environment variable is set to "screen" (the default 
	of "screen").]
	<br>Worse, however, screen apparently transforms cursor positioning 
	commands from the application into relative cursor positioning 
	towards the host terminal, which results in grossly incorrect 
	display positionining if e.g. screen runs in a UTF-8 terminal but 
	assumes an 8 bit terminal. Also, it interprets certain UTF-8 
	continuation bytes as control characters, so even using a workaround 
	it is not possible to fix display for all cases.
	Mined applies a workaround to fix text positioning and menu display 
	problems with screen.
	Another workaround fixes many cases of UTF-8 character display but 
	cannot fix all (since screen captures the output of the 0x9C byte).
	It is recommended to invoke screen only with properly configured 
	locale environment variables to match the actual terminal encoding.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>mintty ("Cygwin Terminal")</b>
	<dt>Mintty is a Windows-based (non-X) terminal running with cygwin.
	Mined auto-detects mintty and adjusts certain properties and 
	features accordingly.
	<li>Mintty supports all kinds of special keyboard features.
	<li>Mined detects font changes that change the CJK ambiguous 
	character width properties of the terminal when notified by 
	mintty if running in UTF-8 mode.
	<li>For good coverage of Unicode characters, recommended fonts 
	for use with mintty are DejaVu Sans Mono, Lucida Console, 
	Courier New, Andale Mono, Everson Mono, SimSun. Discouraged 
	are Lucida Sans Typewriter, Letter Gothic, Courier, Monaco, 
	and older MS CJK fonts, at least for their lack of (proper) 
	graphic characters (for menu borders).
	Mined uses the glyph detection feature of mintty (since 0.9.9) 
	to configure a nice set of useful line markers and menu graphics.
	<li>If break interruption (Control-\ key) does not work on 
	international keyboards (if AltGr is involved), use the 
	special Control-Break keyboard function instead.
	<li>Note: For right-to-left text editing, the bidi feature of 
	mintty interferes with the scrollbar of mined; you may disable 
	the scrollbar with <code class=option>-o</code> to reduce visual 
	confusion.
	(Context-dependent scrollbar display is planned for a later version.)
	<li>Note: With the command scripts <code>wined</code> or 
	<code>wined.bat</code>, mined is invoked in a separate Windows 
	terminal session, using mintty if available.
	<li>Note: On some systems, mouse wheel scrolling does not work in mintty 
	if the mintty scrollbar is enabled. It can be disabled in the mintty 
	"Options..." menu, section "Window".
	<li>Note: Mined temporarily disables mintty shortcut keys for 
	Windows functions (like Alt-function keys, Alt-space, Alt-Enter) 
	in order to use them itself. To toggle mintty full-screen 
	mode, open the mintty menu with Shift-right mouse button, item 
	"Fullscreen".
	<br>(With mintty versions before 0.5.1, for proper usage of 
	Unix-like keyboards functions, the following settings are recommended:
	In Options - Keys, disable the Shortcuts "Window commands" 
	and "Copy and paste".
	In Options - Text, disable "Show bold as bright".)

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Cygwin console</b>
	<li>The cygwin console terminal emulation does not support 
	Shift-F1, Shift-F2 (which cannot be distinguished from F11, F12), 
	Shift-F11, Shift-F12; Control or Alt modified function keys are 
	supported beginning cygwin 1.7.2.
	<li>Mined detects UTF-8 mode of cygwin 1.7 console (by <span class=env>LC_</span>*/<span class=env>LANG</span> setting 
	or for cygwin 1.7 beta by <span class=env>CYGWIN</span> containing "codepage:utf8").
	<br>Note: After rlogin from this console, UTF-8 indication has 
	to be ensured explicitly, e.g. by environment setting, or by 
	mined option <code class=option>+U</code>.
	<li>Note: Cygwin console in UTF-8 mode provides extended Unicode 
	font support if you select "Lucida Console" or another 
	TrueType font from its Properties menu.
	<li>If the Windows program <code>chcp.com</code> is used within 
	cygwin, and the console window is set up to use "Raster Fonts", 
	non-ASCII characters may be mangled.
	<li>Mouse coordinates are not properly reported with wheel scrolling 
	in the cygwin console; for that reason, opening a menu with mouse 
	scrolling does not work.
	<li>See also README.cygwin for more detailed hints on weird 
	details about the Windows console in different modes.
	<li>See also <a href=#pcterminals>PC terminals</a> above.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Windows console window (DOS command prompt)</b>
	<li>The Windows console window is normally configured to run 
	in CP850 encoding or other legacy encodings (depending on 
	localized Windows configuration), it may also turn out to be using CP437.
	Non-displayable characters are replaced as usual.
	The configured font may also affect the effective display 
	character set.
	<li><i>However,</i> if running a cygwin application (like 
	the cygwin version of mined) from a Windows console, the 
	cygwin emulated terminal encoding applies instead, e.g. UTF-8.
	<li><i>Note:</i> The (djgpp-compiled) DOS version of mined 
	automatically adjusts to the selected console codepage (e.g. using 
	the chcp command), it is advisable to set up the console windows 
	to use "Raster Fonts" if this is used.
	With the cygwin-compiled version, on the other hand, using a 
	TrueType font is more stable with respect to character set problems.
	<li>With the djgpp-compiled version apparently there is a 
	Ctrl-C problem on older Windows versions. Every first 
	Ctrl-C will display ^C on the screen at the current position 
	without mined noticing it, while every second Ctrl-C will 
	be passed to mined. This problem does not occur on Windows XP.
	It does occur on Windows ME in a Windows console window.
	It does not occur with the cygwin-compiled version.
	<li>See also <a href=#pcterminals>PC terminals</a> above.

	<li>Mined detects a Windows PowerShell window and adjusts to its limitations.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Poderosa</b>
	<li>This Windows terminal emulator can be used for UTF-8 editing.
	To ensure proper function, do not use Terminal Type "kterm" 
	or Encoding "euc-jp" or "shift-jis"
	<li>Mined auto-detection and terminal initialization can cause 
	Poderosa to display warning popups. To avoid them, Select 
	Tools - Options... - Terminal; for "Behavior in case of 
	unexpected chars", disable "Display a message box".
	If you get a notice "Failed to decode characters by the 
	current encoding utf-8.", click "Do not display this message 
	from next time".
	<li>Poderosa does not provide mouse support for applications.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Terminator</b>
	<li>In Edit - Preferences, enable "Use alt key as meta key".
	<li>Terminator does not provide mouse support for applications.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>PuTTY</b>
	<li>This Windows terminal emulation for remote login provides 
	various keyboard (esp. keypad and function key) assignment 
	emulations. In SCO mode, shifted function keys are different 
	from those of xterm SCO function key emulation; both are 
	supported.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>Better Terminal and Terminal Emulator (Android)</b>
	<li>There are lots of deficiencies in screen control; 
	mined adapts to Better Terminal.
	<li>There are lots of deficiencies in using a real keyboard.
	<li>To use a real keyboard, in the terminal settings, map 
	Control to Left Alt key.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>luit</b>
	<li>The locale support add-on for text terminals luit which 
	applies encoding transformations (e.g. with <span class=env>LC_ALL</span>=zh_CN.gb18030) 
	often maps characters incorrectly, including using the wrong 
	cell width.

	<a name=decterm></a>
	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>DECterm</b>
	<dt>On a VMS system, a DECterm window should be started with:
	<code>CREATE /TERMINAL /DETACH</code>
	<li>Mined cannot disable flow control option (terminal using 
	^S and ^Q characters) despite its handling of the TTSYNC and 
	HOSTSYNC terminal driver options. To make them usable, DECterm 
	needs to be configured manually: Options menu - Keyboard... - 
	disable Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-S = Hold; then Options - Save Options.
	<li>On a remote DECterm, numeric keypad and function keys may not 
	work properly without additional X configuration (xmodmap). Also the 
	AltGr key does not work, making some characters unreachable on 
	international keyboards.
	<li>For VT100 graphics characters (used for menu borders), the 
	DECtech fonts (X fonts with -DEC-DECtech encoding) need to be 
	installed on the X server. If the Cygwin/X server is used, the 
	font-bitstream-dpi* packages should be installed to this aim.

	<p><img border=0 align=left src=terminal.png><b>dtterm</b>
	<li>With the SCO default font, dtterm does not display non-ASCII 
	characters and even worse, they corrupt further display.
	Mined does not, however, set its screen encoding assumption 
	to ASCII as dtterm behaves properly with all other fonts 
	(e.g. 10x20, lucidasanstypewriter, courier).
	<li>Home/End, PgUp/PgDn, and HOP keys need to be used with Shift.

<h4>Work-around support to enable 8-bit character set on weird terminals</h4>
	There exist some exceptionally weird 7 bit terminals that 
	have an alternative character set containing composed characters 
	which can be displayed simultaneously with the default character 
	set. For those there is optional output translation which 
	embeds non-ASCII characters into the respective code switching 
	sequences. To enable output character transformation, set the 
	environment variable <span class=env>MINEDOUT</span> to contain the upper half (with 
	respect to an 8 bit character set) of the translation table 
	into the terminal's alternate character set.
	(Character set switching will be done as specified in the 
	termcap (as/ae) or terminfo (smacs/rmacs) entry.)
	An example setting of <span class=env>MINEDOUT</span> is included in the environment 
	sample file <code class=path>profile.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	for Siemens 9780x terminals.

<h4>Concerning some especially stupid terminal drivers</h4>
	There used to be terminal drivers which make use of the 
	soft handshake mechanism by exchange of ^S and ^Q characters but 
	yet pass them through to application programs which is quite stupid.
	If it is necessary to ignore such hazardous ^S and ^Q keys, 
	the environment variable NoCtrlSQ or NoControlSQ must be set. 
	Mined will then not disable the tty channel soft handshake 
	setting either.

<a name=MINEDKEYMAP></a>
<h3>	Keyboard mapping / Input method preselection</h3>
	With the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDKEYMAP</span> the active or 
	standby mapping or both can be preselected. The value is a 
	two-letter script tag to set the active mapping, or it is 
	prepended with "-" to set the standby mapping, or a combination.
	<br><i>Example:</i>
	    <dd>
	    <code>export <span class=env>MINEDKEYMAP</span>=-gr</code>
	    will set Greek keyboard mapping standby.
	    <dd>
	    <code>export <span class=env>MINEDKEYMAP</span>=py-rs</code>
	    will set Pinyin input method active and Radical/Stroke 
	    input method standby.
	<br>The respective tags attached to the keyboard mappings can be 
	looked up in the Input Method flag menu; the HOP function 
	toggles between display of the full input method name and its tag.

<a name=smartquotesconf></a>
<h3>	Smart Quotes style configuration</h3>
	Smart quotes style can also be preselected with the environment 
	variable <span class=env>MINEDQUOTES</span> 
	(in addition to command line option <code class=option>-q=...</code>, 
	standard locale environment variables, or additional locale 
	environment variables <span class=env>LANGUAGE</span> or 
	<span class=env>TEXTLANG</span> which also implicitly set smart quotes mode).
	<br>The value of <span class=env>MINEDQUOTES</span> should contain 
	the opening/closing quote pair (or just the opening quote 
	mark, double or single quotes) and must be UTF-8 encoded. It 
	can optionally append a space and an inner quotation mark (as 
	used for nested quotations) for more specific selection. It 
	can also indicate French spacing as shown in the example.
	<br><i>Examples (for values of -q parameter or MINEDQUOTES variable):</i>
	    <dd>
	    <code class=option>»</code>
	    sets »Danish« quotes style and corresponding single smart quotes.
	    <dd>
	    <code class=option>»»</code>
	    sets »Finnish» quotes style and corresponding single smart quotes.
	    <dd>
	    <code class=option>«» ''</code> (where <code>''</code> denotes a 
	    left double quotation mark U+201C)
	    sets «Spanish» quotes style with English style inner quotation marks.
	    <dd>
	    <code class=option>« »</code>
	    sets « French » quotes style with embedded spacing.

<h3>	Common paste buffer configuration</h3>
	The paste buffers, used for cut/copy/paste operations, as well as 
	the inter-window paste buffer, are located in a temporary 
	directory, using system conventions by default.
	To maintain the inter-window paste functionality even remotely, 
	mined uses the environement variables <span class=env>MINEDTMP</span> and <span class=env>MINEDUSER</span> 
	which, in combination, point to a user-defined temporary directory 
	and file name pattern to be used for buffer files:
	<ul>
	<li>Set <span class=env>MINEDTMP</span> to refer to a common mounted network directory 
	on all machines which means that the value of <span class=env>$MINEDTMP</span> may have 
	to be different to reflect different mount points across the network.
	(On VMS, use SYS$MINEDTMP).
	<li>Set <span class=env>MINEDUSER</span> to the same name within the network even if 
	using different user name accounts.
	</ul>
	For details, see also the <a href=#files>FILES</a> section below.

<a name=keyconf></a>
<h3>	Keypad configuration</h3>
	Some X configuration may have to be applied to enable keyboard 
	input features as used by mined:
	<ul>
	<li>Alt key modifier for quicker entry of "ESC" commands.
	<li>Assignment of the HOP function to the middle keypad key ("5").
	<li>Assignment of the HOP function to other keys 
	(especially for convenience on laptops which do not have the 
	numeric keypad), e.g. the Pause or Scroll Lock key.
	<li>Distinguish "Home" and "End" keys of the two keypads 
	in order to make use of this redundancy of typical keyboard layout 
	(which is actually a waste of physical resources, causing 
	unnecessary wrist strain because it increase the distance to 
	be moved over for reaching to the mouse).
	<li>Enable control and shift modifiers for keypad and function keys.
	<li>Enable control and shift modifiers for digit keys (for use 
	as accent prefix).
	<li>Enable control modifier for punctuation keys (for use 
	as accent prefix).
	</ul>
	See the example file <code class=path>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> for suggestions.

<a name=printconf></a>
<h3>	Printing configuration</h3>
	Mined uses the script <code>uprint</code> from the 
	<a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> 
	to print the current contents of the text being edited 
	in any selected encoding (unless the environment variable 
	<span class=env>MINEDPRINT</span> is set to direct mined to use a different print command).
	<br>If the support library is not installed in one of its 
	standard locations (system-dependent), it should be made 
	available in the usual command search path.
	<br>The script offers a choice of configured printers to select 
	one (using either Windows registry or CUPS lpstat).
	<br>The script uses either <code>paps</code> or 
	<code>uniprint</code> for actual formatting (print preprocessing).
	Under Windows (cygwin/stand-alone/djgpp versions), 
	mined also considers printing with <code>notepad /p</code>.
	<br><code>paps</code> is available at 
	<a target=paps href=https://github.com/dov/paps>
	https://github.com/dov/paps</a> and uses the Pango layout 
	engine for formatting.
	<code>uniprint</code> is part of the yudit distribution; if 
	you don't have it installed on your system, there is another 
	script <code>makeprint</code> in the support library which can be 
	used to download and build the needed <code>uniprint</code> program.
	The mined print script (<code>uprint</code>) prefers 
	<code>paps</code> if it is available as it has more capabilities 
	for printing a wide range of Unicode characters, and it does 
	right-to-left formatting.
	<br>The font to be used with <code>uprint</code> can be configured with 
	the environment variables <span class=env>FONT</span>, <span class=env>FONTPATH</span>, <span class=env>FONTSIZE</span>.
	It is recommended to put a sufficient font in the directories of 
	<span class=env>$FONTPATH</span>, e.g. DroidSansMono, 
	LucidaTypewriterRegular, Bitstream Cyberbit.
	<br>The preferred printer can be configured as usual with 
	the environment variable <span class=env>PRINTER</span>.
	In addition, <code>uprint</code> checks an environment 
	variable <span class=env>LPR</span> for an alternative for the 
	system printing command (lpr/lp) if that is needed.
	<br><i>Note:</i> If printing with <code>uprint</code> fails for 
	some reason, mined tries to print with either the print 
	command configured in the environment variable 
	<span class=env>LPR</span> as a fallback, or with lp/lpr as a last 
	resort. Working character encoding support cannot be expected 
	in this case, however.
	<br>See <a href=#printenv>Environment variables to configure Printing</a> 
	for further details.

<a name=layout></a>
<h3>	Display layout</h3>
	Some of the special indication characters (that substitute 
	non-displayable contents) and some of the colours used by mined 
	for special indications and interactive elements may be 
	configured to the user's preference.
	<br><i>Note:</i> For the configurable character indications, two 
	environment variables exist each, to configure an 8 bit value 
	(Latin-1 encoded) and to configure a Unicode value (UTF-8 encoded).
	The UTF-8 encoded values (e.g. <span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span>) take precedence 
	in a UTF-8 terminal. In an 8 bit terminal, or if the respective 
	UTF-8 variable is not configured, the Latin-1 encoded value applies.
	See the example script <code class=path>profile.mined</code> 
	in the <a href=#support>Mined runtime support library</a> for 
	more details and for a number of suggestions of suitable values.
	Mined does not apply any default non-Latin-1 indications in order 
	to avoid display problems with fonts that do not support them.
	Depending on your visual preference, there are a number of suitable 
	Unicode characters for use as indications especially in the Unicode 
	ranges of Arrows, Geometric Shapes and Symbols (U+2190-U+2BFF).
	<br><i>Note:</i> For the Latin-1 encoded configured indication 
	markers (variables <span class=env>MINEDRET</span> etc, not <span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span> etc), if the 
	configured character is in the small letters range (actually 
	'`'...DEL) the alternate character set is used for display. 
	This works also in a UTF-8 terminal, provided that the 
	corresponding UTF-8-encoded indication configuration variable 
	is not set, e.g. <span class=env>MINEDRET</span>=j <span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span>= (or not defined) 
	would indicate line-ends by displaying a graphic lower right 
	corner, <span class=env>MINEDTAB</span>='`' <span class=env>MINEDUTFTAB</span>= (or not defined) would indicate 
	Tab characters with VT100 graphics lozenge rhombs.
	<br><i>Note:</i> For the UTF-8-encoded configured indication 
	markers (variables <span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span> etc), if the marker is a 
	double-width character, a replacement will be displayed instead.
	<br><i>Note:</i> Mined reduces its assumptions about available 
	graphic and special characters for display purposes with the 
	options <code class=option>-f</code> or <code class=option>-F</code>.
	The <code class=option>-F</code> option also suppresses the 
	interpretation of the <span class=env>MINEDUTF</span>* environment variables.

<h4>Line ends</h4>
	Line ends are usually marked by a "«" double left angle character.
	This visual indication can be changed with the environment variable 
	<span class=env>MINEDRET</span> (8 bit terminals) or <span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span> (UTF-8 terminals).
	The default or configured marker is used as an indicator at 
	the end of every text line on screen (so you can see how many 
	blank spaces there are).
	<br>Multi-character markers: If a second character is configured, 
	it is used to fill the rest of the screen line, a third 
	configured character would terminate the indication at the end 
	of the screen line. ("··«" is a nice setting for people who 
	used to work at Siemens terminals.)
	<dd>Pattern:
<pre>
		<span class=env>MINEDRET</span>=123	# line end displays as 122222223
</pre>
	<dd>Suggestion for a nice line end on UTF-8 mode terminals 
	(check if character is included in your font, however!):
<pre>
		<span class=env>MINEDUTFRET</span>=&#9166;	# U+23CE
</pre>
	<p>The indication of DOS line ends (CRLF) and Mac line ends (CR) 
	may be configured with the variables <span class=env>MINEDDOSRET</span> or <span class=env>MINEDUTFDOSRET</span>, 
	and <span class=env>MINEDMACRET</span> or <span class=env>MINEDUTFMACRET</span>, respectively.
	They are also distinguished by different colours.
<h4>Paragraph ends</h4>
	With the option <code class=option>-p</code>, mined displays 
	distinct indicators for line ends and paragraph ends.
	A paragraph is defined to continue while lines end with white 
	space (space or Tab character).
	The default paragraph marker is "¶" and is also used to indicate 
	a line ending with a Unicode Paragraph Separator. It can be 
	changed with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDPARA</span> or <span class=env>MINEDUTFPARA</span>.
<h4>Tab characters</h4>
	Tab characters are usually indicated by a sequence of '·' 
	(middle dot) characters.
	This can be changed with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDTAB</span> 
	(8 bit terminal) or <span class=env>MINEDUTFTAB</span> (UTF-8 terminals).
	<br>Multi-character markers: If two characters are configured, 
	the second is used to mark the middle of the Tab span. If three 
	characters are configured, the first and last are used to mark 
	the beginning and end of the Tab span.
	<dd>Pattern:
<pre>
		<span class=env>MINEDTAB</span>=123	# Tab displays as 12222223
		<span class=env>MINEDTAB</span>=12	# Tab displays as 11112111
</pre>
<h4>Long lines</h4>
	Lines which are too long for the screen are usually indicated 
	by a '»' double right angle (guillemot) character. If the current 
	position is behind the screen margin, the line is shifted out left 
	which is indicated by a '«' double left angle.
	These markers can be changed with the environment variable 
	<span class=env>MINEDSHIFT</span> or <span class=env>MINEDUTFSHIFT</span>. The first character is used to 
	indicate a line continued to the left of the screen, the second 
	character is used to indicate a line continued to the right of 
	the screen.
<h4>Unicode characters</h4>
	For a description of special display indications in UTF-8 text 
	editing mode see "<a href=#utf8display>Unicode display</a>" above.
	The indication and highlighting mode of a non-displayable Unicode 
	character (typically a UTF-8 character in a Latin-1 terminal), 
	as well as the highlighting mode (colour) of the indication of 
	illegal UTF-8 sequences, can be configured with the variable 
	<span class=env>MINEDUNI</span>.
<h4>Display mode of indicators</h4>
	It is recommended to display these indicator characters in a dim 
	display mode to prevent distraction from the text contents. The 
	default is a red colour which is a moderate dark red in xterm.
	The display mode can be used by placing the code part of an ANSI 
	display control sequence in the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDDIM</span>.
	E.g., <span class=env>MINEDDIM</span>=31 would select the default mode, red foreground;
	in xterm only, <span class=env>MINEDDIM</span>="38;5;83;38;5;245" gives a moderate gray 
	in either 88 or 256 color mode;
	in rxvt only, <span class=env>MINEDDIM</span>="38;5;83" gives a moderate gray.
	<br><span class=env>MINEDDIM</span> can also be set to an 
	integer percentage value (e.g. <span class=env>MINEDIM</span>="50%") 
	to have mined apply dim colour to the indications; the colour 
	value is computed from the current foreground and background 
	colours (works in xterm, or mintty from version 404). The ANSI 
	colour 7 (white) is temporarily redefined for this purpose and 
	restored when mined exits.
<h4>Display mode of menu borders</h4>
	The display colour of menu borders and menu headers can be 
	configured with the environment variable <span class=env>MINEDBORDER</span>.
	Suitable values are "35" (magenta), "34" (blue) and "31" (default).
<h4>Status line highlighting</h4>
	Highlighted parts of status line messages (e.g. initial letters 
	for help selection after F1) can be configured with the 
	environment variable <span class=env>MINEDEMPH</span>, using foreground ANSI modes.
	The default is "31" (effectively red background).
<h4>Scrollbar colour</h4>
	The foreground and background colours of the scrollbar can 
	be configured with <span class=env>MINEDSCROLLFG</span> and <span class=env>MINEDSCROLLBG</span>, respectively, 
	using ANSI modes; if only the background is configured, 
	the foreground is the reverse of it. In general, to support 
	fine-grained scrollbar display in UTF-8 terminals, the 
	foreground and background colour settings should be the 
	reverse of each other.
	The default for the background is "46;34;48;5;45" if 
	use of 256 colour mode is enabled, or "46;34" if it is disabled.
	The default for the foreground is "", meaning that the reverse 
	background is used, with a workaround for hanterm (see above).
<h4>Menu colour and border style</h4>
	The highlighting background colour of the selected menu item 
	can be configured with <span class=env>MINEDSEL</span>, using reverse ANSI modes (i.e. 
	using foreground parameters for the background) and <span class=env>MINEDSELFG</span> 
	for the foreground, using reverse ANSI modes. The default values 
	are <span class=env>MINEDSELFG</span>="43" and <span class=env>MINEDSEL</span>="34", giving yellow on blue.
	If selected menu items appear too dark (which mined tries to 
	avoid, depending on the terminal), try one of the workarounds 
	<span class=env>MINEDSEL</span>="34;1" or <span class=env>MINEDSELFG</span>="43;1".
	<br>Menu border styles can be selected with the option 
	<code class=option>-Q</code>.
	For a nice selection bar that extends from left to right menu 
	border, the setting <code class=option>-QQ</code> is 
	recommended (this is the default unless the terminal is 
	assumed not to provide sufficient font configuration for this 
	option; it depends on certain graphic Unicode characters being 
	included in the terminal font and can be disabled with 
	<code class=option>-Qq</code>).
<h4>Combining character display</h4>
	The highlighting background colour of combining characters 
	displayed in separated mode can be configured with 
	<span class=env>MINEDCOMBINING</span>, using ANSI background modes.
	The default value is <span class=env>MINEDCOMBINING</span>=46, to change colour e.g. 
	to yellow background, use <span class=env>MINEDCOMBINING</span>=43.

<h3>	Interactive Help access</h3>
	Mined looks for its help file in a number of typical directories 
	for installation of the Mined runtime support library.
	If it is placed in a non-standard location, the environment 
	variable <span class=env>MINEDDIR</span> should point to the directory.
	(Mined also tries to find the help file in the directory 
	where it was started from; this is especially useful for the 
	DOS/Windows version.)

<p><hr width=95%>
<h3>	Mined compile-time configuration</h3>
<h4>Script highlighting</h4>
	The the mined distribution contains a file 
	<code class=path>src/colours.cfg</code>; it contains entries with the 
	script name (as listed in the Unicode data file 
	<code class=path>Scripts.txt</code>), blank space, and a colour index 
	into the xterm 256-colour mode. (To make good use of 256 
	colour mode, the terminal program should be compiled with 256 
	colour support enabled. Configure xterm with 
	<code>configure --enable-256-color</code> .)
	<br>Edit <code class=path>colours.cfg</code> before building mined to 
	adapt coloured script display to your preferences.
<h4>Encodings and Encoding menu</h4>
	The mined distribution contains a file <code class=path>src/charmaps.cfg</code> 
	which defines the character encodings that mined knows and how 
	they are presented in the Encoding menu, together with flags for 
	indication in the Encoding flag and tags for use with the 
	<code class=option>-E</code> and <code class=option>+E</code> 
	options (and the <span class=env>MINEDDETECT</span> environment variable).
	<br>The configuration file allows the definition of submenus in the 
	Encoding menu.
	<br>Each character encoding entry <code>charmap-name</code> must 
	correspond to an existing character mapping file 
	<code class=path>charmaps/charmap-name.map</code>.
	Additional character mappings can be generated with the script 
	<code>mkchrmap</code>.
<h4>Encodings recognised by locale names</h4>
	The mined distribution contains a file <code class=path>src/locales.cfg</code> 
	which maps locale names to associated character encodings.
	While this list contains mainly locale names without explicit 
	encoding suffix, mined also checks generic locale name suffix 
	values and assumes the corresponding terminal encoding.
	Thus the given names or suffixes can be used even on legacy 
	systems without locale support to indicate the terminal 
	environment and preferred text encoding properly to mined.
<a name=mkkbmap></a>
<h4>Keyboard mapping (Input method)</h4>
	The mined distribution contains a file <code class=path>src/keymaps.cfg</code> 
	and a script <code>mkkbmap</code>; go into the 
	<code class=path>src</code> directory and use the script to generate 
	additional keyboard mappings:
	The parameter to the <code>mkkbmap</code> script can be one of
	<ul>
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.mim</code>
	<dd>a keyboard mapping file of the m17n-db multilingualization package
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.kmap</code>
	<dd>a keyboard mapping file of the yudit text editor
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.vim</code>
	<dd>a keyboard mapping file of the vim text editor
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.cit</code>
	<dd>an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, 
		binary form; only works if the cxterm binary/text 
		conversion utility cit2tit is accessible
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.tit</code>
	<dd>an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, 
		text form; only works if the character set 
		conversion utility iconv is accessible and 
		works on the mapping file
	<dt><code class=path>path.../name.utf</code>
	<dd>an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, 
		already converted to UTF-8 encoding (e.g. with iconv)
	<dt>Cangjie [ &lt HKSCS Changjie table file name > ]
	<dd>with this tag, a keyboard mapping for the Cangjie input method 
		will be generated,
		taking information from the Unihan database (unicode.org);
		<br>
		with a second parameter, a Big5-encoded table of HKSCS 
		Changjie input codes will be merged in, 
		the parameter is either the file name or a <code>+</code> 
		sign which is implicitly expanded to the relative path name
		<code class=path>etc/charmaps/hkscs/hkscs-2004-cj.txt</code>;
		the HKSCS input codes file should be taken from 
		http://info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/hkscs/
	<dt>MainlandTelegraph , TaiwanTelegraph
	<dd>with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated 
		using one of these telegraph codes as an input method,
		taking information from the Unihan database (unicode.org)
	<dt>Cantonese , HanyuPinlu , Mandarin , Tang
	<dd>with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated 
		using the according Chinese pronunciation as an input method,
		taking information from the Unihan database (unicode.org)
	<dt>JapaneseKun , JapaneseOn
	<dd>with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated 
		using Japanese or Sino-Japanese pronunciation as an input method,
		taking information from the Unihan database (unicode.org)
	<dt>Korean , Vietnamese
	<dd>with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated 
		using Korean or Vietnamese pronunciation as an input method,
		taking information from the Unihan database (unicode.org)
	<dt>VIQR , VNI , Vtelex
	<dd>with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated 
		for the respective Vietnamese input methods,
		taking character information from the Unicode database (unicode.org)
	<dt><i>script tag</i>
	<dd>for many scripts listed in the UnicodeData.txt database, 
		character names listed there can build a useful 
		keyboard mapping; 
		<code>mkkbmap</code> will then generate an according 
		keyboard mapping file, e.g. for Bopomofo
	</ul>
	Each successful generation of a mapping table adds an entry 
	to the configuration file <code class=path>keymaps.cfg</code>; the 
	entry is however initially disabled as it usually needs manual 
	adjustment: edit the configuration file; enable the new 
	entry by removing the leading '#' character, check the first 
	element which will be the name of the mapping to appear in the 
	Input Method menu, check the last element of the entry 
	which is a two-letter shortcut and must be unique for all 
	mappings, then move the entry to the position where you want 
	it to appear in the menu. You can also group mappings by 
	adding "-" lines in this configuration file.
	<br>
	For the Unicode data version used for included keyboard mappings, 
	see the mined change log.
	<br>
	For the keyboard mappings generated from Unihan data, 
	characters are sorted according to the priorities of their 
	Unicode ranges (assigning lower priority to "Supplement" and 
	"Extension" and "Compatibility" ranges).
	So for some input mnemos, the "pick list" for the Cangjie 
	input method is displayed more in order of relevance.
	<br>
	For keyboard mappings for CJK encodings, mkkbmap will add 
	appropriate punctuation mapping entries for Chinese, Japanese, 
	Korean, respectively, in addition to the entries derived from 
	the respective data source.
