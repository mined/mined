I do like having a small editor that can deal with unicode.
<tr><td><td>
<td colspan=7 bgcolor=#FDB297>
I find it quite neat that you can use the mouse ... although it is a console app.

... really nicely done. 
In particular the menus and the mouse interaction are very pretty.

<h3>Introduction to MinEd</h3>
Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive yet concise and 
easy-to-use user interface supporting modern interaction paradigms, 
and fast, small-footprint behaviour.
<p>
Mined provides both extensive Unicode and CJK support offering many 
specific features and covering special cases that other editors 
are not aware of (like auto-detection features and automatic handling 
of terminal variations, or Han character information).
<p>
Mined supports full mouse control and menu system in plain-text terminals 
(and it was the first editor supporting Unicode in xterm).
<p>
Mined offers a full set of text and file management features, like 
data loss prevention (using backup, recovery files, and file locking 
interoperable with other editors, and file change monitoring), 
an interactive file chooser, and an interactive file switcher.
<p>
Basically, mined is an editor tailored to reliable and efficient 
editing of plain text documents and programs, with comfortable 
features and intuitive interactive behaviour designed for this purpose.
