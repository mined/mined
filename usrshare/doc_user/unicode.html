<h4>Handling Unicode text with mined</h4>

<dl>

<p>
<dt><i>Screen handling</i>
<dd>
	Usually, mined will auto-detect a UTF-8 terminal and also 
	the detailed features it has (like double-width and 
	combining characters, Arabic ligature joining, different width 
	data sets).

<p>
<dt><i>Character encoding</i>
<dd>
	By default, mined detects automatically if the text in an edited 
	file is UTF-8 encoded (Unicode character set) or not (either 
	8 bit encoded or CJK encoded); it also detects and maintains UTF-16.
	<br>
	Mined handles illegal UTF-8 sequences transparently so 
	if you accidentally open an 8 bit or CJK encoded file in UTF-8 
	mode, or a file with mixed parts, you can edit the text without 
	problems and will not loose any information. Non-UTF-8 codes 
	are indicated by display background highlighting.
	<br>
	While editing, you can switch the character encoding assumed 
	for text interpretation with the encoding menu 
	(left-click to toggle current and previous encoding, 
	right-click to open menu).

<p>
<dt><i>Unicode display on non-Unicode terminal</i>
<dd>
	Characters that cannot be displayed in the encoding of the terminal 
	are indicated by some suitable replacement, indicated by 
	coloured background.
	Indications are chosen as to suggest the text character as best 
	as possible, with special indications for combining characters 
	<code class=unispecial>'</code>, 
	quotation marks <code class=unispecial>"</code>, 
	dashes <code class=unispecial>-</code>, 
	the Euro symbol <code class=unispecial>E</code> etc., and 
	using a base character according to <i>Unicode decomposition</i> 
	for accented and other precomposed characters.
	<br>
	Please consult the manual page, section 
	<a href=mined.html#utf8display>Unicode display</a> for details.

<p>
<dt><i>Combining characters</i>
<dd>
	Mined supports display and editing of combined characters 
	consisting of a base character and one or more combining 
	characters, in one of two modes:
	<ul>
	<li>Combined display mode: combined characters are displayed as 
	they should appear, navigation within the combined character 
	is possible (Control-cursor-left/right), the character information 
	display (HOP ESC u, or from “?” Info menu) shows which part (base 
	or combining character) of the combined character you are 
	positioned on, Mark/Copy/Paste and Control-Del acts on the 
	respective position.
	<li>Separated display mode: base character and combining characters 
	are separated for explicit handling.
	</ul>
	These modes can be selected and are indicated in the 
	Combining display flag: <code>ç</code>: combined mode, 
	<code class=unispecial>`</code>: separated mode.
	<br>
	See the manual page, section <a href=mined.html#combined>
	Combining characters</a> for details.

<p>
<dt><i>Bidirectional display</i>
<dd>
	Mined auto-detects if it is running in a terminal supporting 
	Arabic (by checking LAM/ALEF ligature joining) and other 
	right-to-left scripts (e.g. mlterm), or it can be told so with 
	the command line parameter <code>+UU</code>.
	<br>
	The mined runtime support library contains a script 
	<code>mterm</code> to invoke the <code>mlterm</code> terminal 
	emulator with suitable parameters to set up bidi mode and a 
	suitable font.

<p>
<dt><i>CJK and 8 bit character set support on Unicode terminal</i>
<dd>
	Mined support for major CJK encodings is also best used in a 
	UTF-8 terminal (unless you need specific CJK input features of 
	dedicated terminals); this setup is also well suited for editing 
	text encoded in various 8 bit character sets.
	<br>
	See the <a href=features.html#cjk>mined features</a> page for an 
	overview of CJK support features.
	<br>
	See the manual page, sections 
	<a href=mined.html#charencoding>Character encoding support</a> and 
	<a href=mined.html#cjk>CJK support</a> for details.

<h4>Unicode environment setup</h4>
<dl>

<p>
<dt><i><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>Quick and easy</i>
<dd>
	Use the command <a href=uterm.html><code>uterm</code></a> to 
	invoke a UTF-8 enabled terminal with automatic selection of a 
	suitable font for best coverage of Unicode characters.
	<ul type=circle>
	<li>The <code>uterm</code> script comes with the mined 
	package; it is included in the mined runtime support library 
	and may be installed in the path with the mined application.
	<li>Note: The <code>uterm</code> script assumes that a UTF-8 enabled 
	version of xterm or rxvt-unicode is already installed on your 
	system, as well as fonts suitable for your needs.
	If this is not the case on your system, follow the advice below.
	</ul>

	<p><i><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>On Windows / cygwin:</i>
	Use the command <code>wined</code> to start mined in a 
	mintty terminal configured to use UTF-8 and Windows 
	look-and-feel.
	<br>(When running an X server, <a href=uterm.html><code>uterm</code></a> 
	works too, as described above.)
	<br>The cygwin 1.7 console also runs UTF-8 by default.

	<p><i><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>On Windows / Explorer:</i>
	With the mined stand-alone Windows package installed, 
	right-click on a text file to open its context menu, and 
	select “MinEd”.

	<p><i><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>On Mac OS X:</i>
	Preferably, use xterm or <a target=_blank href=http://www.iterm2.com/>iTerm 2</a>
	as the native Mac terminal application does not support the mouse.

<p>
<dt><i>Install suitable terminal</i>
<dd>
	Mined is a text mode editor. Its UTF-8 display and input support 
	is available with terminal emulators supporting UTF-8 and running 
	in UTF-8 mode, like 
	<a target=_blank href=http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html>
	xterm</a> (version >= 145), 
	<a target=_blank href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/rxvt-unicode>
	rxvt-unicode</a>, 
	<a target=_blank href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mlterm>
	mlterm</a>, KDE konsole, gnome-terminal, Linux console, 
	cygwin console, mintty, PuTTY.
	<ul>
	<li>If you don't have a recent version of xterm on your 
	system, compile it yourself; 
	invoke <code>configure --enable-wide-chars</code> or use the script 
	<code>configure-xterm</code> from the mined runtime support 
	library. Then invoke <code>make</code>. You may want to compact 
	the resulting executable with <code>strip xterm</code>; then 
	install it into your path, e.g. in <code>$HOME/bin</code>.
	<br><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>Note: xterm, like 
	mined, can be used to enable UTF-8 and Unicode support on 
	legacy systems, even if they do not offer any “locale” support, 
	and without needing root privilege.
	</ul>

<p>
<dt><i>Install suitable fonts</i>
<dd>
	Install Unicode fonts for your X server.
<ul>
<li>To check if your X installation already provides Unicode fonts, 
you may invoke the command <nobr><code>xlsfonts | grep iso10646</code></nobr>.
If this doesn't list anything, or if you cannot find a suitable font 
setup, do one of the following:
<dl>
<dd>

<li><i>Automatic installation:</i>
<dd>The Mined runtime support library contains a script 
<code>installfonts</code> that downloads these fonts and installs them 
with your X server. It finally gives some hints how to add them to 
your permanent font configuration.

<li><i>Manual installation:</i>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve some of the following fonts:
<ol>
<li>	<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz>
	UCS fonts for X</a>
	with their 
	<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts-asian.tar.gz>
	CJK supplement</a>
	from Markus Kuhn's page
	<a target=_blank href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html>
	Unicode fonts and tools for X11</a>
<li>	<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts-75dpi100dpi.tar.gz>
	Adobe and B&H bitmap fonts</a>
	from the same site which contain fixed width Courier and 
	Lucida Typewriter fonts
<li>	<a href=http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/uni-vga.tgz>
	Unicode VGA font</a>
	from 
	<a target=_blank href=http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/>
	Dmitry Bolkhovityanov</a>'s site
<li>	<href=http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/Monospace/MonospaceRoman.bdf.tar.gz>
	Monospace Roman BDF fonts</a>
	and their Oblique / Bold / Bold Oblique supplements from 
	<a target=_blank href=http://bibliofile.mc.duke.edu/gww/fonts/Unicode.html>
	George Williams Unicode fonts page</a>
</ol>

<li>The nicest looking font in the UCS fonts archive mentioned above 
is the 10x20 size font, it is suitable for higher screen resolutions.
Unfortunately, the CJK double-width fonts are not distributed in 
the corresponding 20x20 size, but only in the 18x18 size. The 
corresponding single-width font in 9x18 size, however, looks quite 
spindly and for my taste rather awkward.
<br>
For this reason, I am providing a script to generate 20x20 CJK fonts 
automatically from the 18x18 UCS fonts distributed for X servers.
It is <code>bdf18to20</code> and you find it in the mined runtime 
support library. Go into the directory where you unpacked the fonts 
and invoke the script.

<li>Install the fonts with your X server: unpack them into a directory 
(e.g. <code>$HOME/xfonts</code>), go into that directory, invoke the 
<code>mkfontdir</code> command. Then make sure that the fonts are 
loaded into your X server, using the command
<code>xset +fp $HOME/xfonts</code>; a suitable place to include this 
automatically would be your <code>$HOME/.xinitrc</code> X 
initialisation file if you have one.
<dl>
<dd><i>Note:</i> If you are working in a network, make sure the xset 
command is invoked such that the X server has access to the given 
directory on the machine it is running on.
<dd>Some X servers (e.g. Exceed on Windows) do not accept BDF fonts; 
use the “Compile Fonts” function of the configuration menu to install 
the fonts.
</dl>

</ul>

</dl>
</ul>

<p>
<dt><i>Start terminal in UTF-8 mode</i>
<dd>
	Invoke a terminal window in UTF-8 mode and configure it to use 
	fonts sufficient to display the text you want to edit.
<ul>
<li>Invoke xterm with suitable resource configuration or command line 
parameters.
<ul>
<li>I recommend to invoke xterm with the script
<a href=uterm.html><code>uterm</code></a> from the mined runtime 
support library.
<li>Alternatively, invoke <code>xterm -u8</code> or 
<code>xterm -en UTF-8</code> to enforce UTF-8 mode, depending on system 
configuration; also the option <code>+lc</code> may be needed in addition.
</ul>
<br><img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif>Mined detects UTF-8 terminal 
mode automatically (exception: cygwin 1.7 UTF-8 console after rlogin 
or telnet).
So it will work even if your locale environment is not configured properly.
<dl>
<dd><i>Note:</i> xterm is quite touchy about configuring suitable 
matching fonts for single-width and double-width glyphs. If you are 
unlucky, CJK character display will result in garbage on the screen. 
My recommendation is to generate the 20x20 UCS fonts with my 
<code>bdf18to20</code> script as mentioned above and configure xterm 
to use 10x20 &ndash; it will then automatically select one of the 20x20 
fonts for double-width characters; if you have a preference among 
them, use the -fw command line option or the wideFont X resource (in 
your <code>$HOME/.Xdefaults</code> file).
See the pattern file <code>Xdefaults.mined</code> in the mined runtime 
support library for suggestions of suitable entries.
(Double-width font matching works much better with rxvt which even seems 
to scale double-width fonts in an acceptable way if needed.)
</dl>

<li>If you prefer rxvt, use rxvt-unicode and make sure to indicate 
using UTF-8 by setting a locale in your environment that is installed 
on your system, for example <code>LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 urxvt</code> on cygwin.
<dl>
<dd><i>Note:</i> rxvt is quite touchy about configuring a known locale 
setting; it does not have a strict UTF-8 option that would reliably 
work on all systems.
</dl>

<li>
<i>Note:</i> For hints how to configure the environment explicitly so 
that rxvt, konsole and other applications work with UTF-8, see the 
mined manual page (about LC_CTYPE and other environment variables).
Accurate locale setting is not needed by xterm and mined.
<br>For other terminals (e.g. mlterm), see their manual for how to 
configure UTF-8 mode.

<li>Alternatively, you can start mined directly together with its own 
terminal window. For this purpose, the mined runtime support library 
contains the script <code>umined</code>.
<img align=absmiddle src=handr.gif> If starting xterm, this script also 
configures xterm on-the-fly to apply the most recent version of 
Unicode width data as built-in to xterm in contrast to system-provided 
locale data (which may refer to an older version of Unicode) for handling 
of wide and combining characters.
<li>On a Windows system, you can also use the script 
<code>wined</code> or <code>wined.bat</code> which will invoke mined 
in a mintty terminal window, configured to use UTF-8 and Windows 
look-and-feel.
