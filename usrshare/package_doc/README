What is MinEd? (Pronounce "min-ed")

Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive and easy-to-use 
user interface and fast, small-footprint behaviour.

For an overview of major features and highlights, see the file DESCR 
or the overview in the HTML documentation (doc/overview.html or 
https://mined.github.io).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick start

See the file INSTALL.DOC on how to build and install mined from its 
source distribution.

This installs the binary program, the manual page, the online help 
file, and the runtime support library, to appropriate locations as 
used by various systems.


Runtime support library
The Mined runtime support library is located in the subdirectory 
usrshare of the mined distribution archive, or, depending on 
system-specific installation, in a typical location like
/usr/share[/lib]/mined, /usr/local/share/mined, or /opt/mined/share.
Its contents is described in detail in the mined manual page.
Remarkable files are:
* Support for optimising a runtime environment:
  - profile.mined
	shell commands to set environment variables for mined, 
	template for inclusion in $HOME/.profile
  - Xdefaults.mined
	xterm configuration entries suitable for mined, template 
	for inclusion in $HOME/.Xdefaults or $HOME/.Xresources;
	the script xinitrc.mined may be used to add this configuration 
	to your environment when logged in to an X server
* Support for invoking mined in a suitable terminal:
  - uterm
	script to invoke xterm in UTF-8 mode
  - umined
	script to start mined in a separate xterm window, using UTF-8 mode
	with most recent version of Unicode width data (specifying 
	wide and combining characters) as built-in to xterm
  - wined[.bat] (for Windows)
	script to start mined in a separate mintty window, 
	using Windows look-and-feel


For Unicode (UTF-8) terminal operation on Unix / X:
* Use a fairly new version of xterm (>= version 145).
  If you need to build an xterm binary program yourself, configure 
  the package with the script configure-xterm from the mined runtime 
  support library.
* Install Unicode fonts for your X server from 
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz 
  and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts-asian.tar.gz for 
  Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.
  Automatic installation: the Mined runtime support library contains 
  a script "installfonts" that downloads these fonts and installs them 
  with your X server. It finally gives some hints how to add them to 
  your permanent font configuration.
  Manual installation: unpack these archives in a directory, e.g. 
  $HOME/xfonts/ucs-fonts, 
  and make sure the X server is set up to include that directory in its 
  font search path:
	xset +fp $HOME/opt/fonts
* Start xterm with the script uterm from the mined runtime support 
  library or with the uxterm command.

Platforms

Mined runs on Linux (including Android and Raspberry Pi), Cygwin, 
Unix systems, and OpenVMS.
Mined also runs on Windows (Cygwin, Interix, MSYS, djgpp, EMX (deprecated)), 
DOS (djgpp, EMX (deprecated), Turbo-C (deprecated)), and Haiku.
Mined is intended to compile and run on as many Unix environments as 
possible, including legacy systems. This has recently been tested for SunOS, 
BSD, Mac OS X, QNX, GNU Hurd, HP-UX, IBM AIX, Irix, SCO UnixWare, Ultrix, Tru64.

For platform-specific installation and setup hints, 
see also README.cygwin, README.dos, README.vms, README.windows.

See also COMPILE.DOC for an overview of makefiles and for 
some platform-specific compilation hints.

See PACKAGE.DOC if you want to make a system-specific mined 
installation package.
