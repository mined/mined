                Unicode text editor MinEd 2015.25

Introduction
------------

Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive and easy-to-use 
user interface and fast, small-footprint behaviour.

It was the first editor that provided Unicode support in a 
plain-text terminal.
It now has both extensive Unicode and CJK support offering many 
specific features and covering special cases that other editors 
are not aware of (like auto-detection features and automatic handling 
of terminal variations, or CJK character information).
And basically, it is an editor tailored to efficient editing 
of plain text documents and programs, with features and interactive 
behaviour designed for this purpose.

Mined has an intuitive, simple way of operation. No modes.
Cursor positioning basic editing is intuitive, character-oriented, 
and without weird limitations at line-end, no insert/append confusion.

Editing support includes
* paragraph adjustment (line/word wrap)
* identifier and function definition search (also across files)
* HTML support
* smart quotes (typographic quote mark replacement, with automatic style)
* versatile character input support features
* combined character support
* search and replacement patterns may include new-lines
* cross-session paste buffer (copy/paste between multiple invocations)
* multiple paste buffers (emacs-style)
* handling of different line-end kinds with distinguished indications
* binary transparency

Mined offers security against file handling mistakes. It will not accidently 
overwrite a file that has not explicitly been opened for editing before 
without prompting. It will not exit from a changed text without saving 
or explicit confirmation.
All file handling errors are reported clearly.
