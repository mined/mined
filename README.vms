What is MinEd? (Pronounce "min-ed")

Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive and easy-to-use 
user interface and fast, small-footprint behaviour.

For an overview of major features and highlights, see https://mined.github.io

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup

The VMS version of mined should be installed and made available as a command 
with a symbolic name, adding to the login script SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM 
$ MINED :== $SYS$LOGIN:MINED
or whereever MINED.EXE is installed.
To enabled short invocation (e.g. with M or E only), use
$ M*INED :== $SYS$LOGIN:MINED
$ E*D :== $SYS$LOGIN:MINED
The help file MINED.HLP should either be installed in the same directory 
as the binary, or its location should be configured:
$ DEFINE MINED$HELP USR$LIBDIR:MINED.HLP

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running mined

In a command prompt, type
	MINED options files
to invoke mined.

Options containing capital letters need to be quoted, e.g.
	MINED "-Qa" [-]*.com
Mined options can also be passed in the symbol MINED$OPT.

Filename expansion is applied, accepting both Unix-like 
and VMS-native subdirectory notations.
File versions can optionally be specified and are handled properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mined features

VMS-specific adaptations are also described in the section on VMS in 
the manual page (http://mined.github.io/, click Mined Manual).

The file chooser (F3 to select a file name for reading or writing) 
accepts Unix-like or VMS-style directory notations for navigation.
Using [] or the top entry in the file navigation popup menu to refresh 
the file list switches to VMS-style listing of all file versions.
Note that opening the file chooser may be slow on large directories.

The file info memory files are called .$mined instead of .@mined,
recovery files are called $name$ instead of #name#.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminals

The capability to accept terminal copy-paste is limited by the VMS 80 
character input buffer (not limited on emulated VMS, e.g. on "Personal 
Alpha"). For some remote terminals (mintty, rxvt), full Unicode data 
version detection is disabled to reduce start-up delay.

DECterm

The DECterm window can be used remotely. It is advisable to install the 
Bitstream bitmap fonts, especially to have the VT100 line drawing graphics 
available (X fonts with -DEC-DECtech encoding). If the Cygwin/X server is 
used, the font-bitstream-dpi* packages should be installed to this aim.

CJK support

In the VAX version, some large tables are disabled in the sources 
(mainly for the sake of compilation speed): Unicode character names 
and decompositions, CJK character encodings and Han character information.
(CJK input methods are not disabled.)
The Alpha and Itanium versions include full CJK support.

Compilation

For VMS-specific compilation hints, see COMPILE.DOC in the source package.
